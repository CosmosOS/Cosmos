# Manifest Resource Streams
Manifest Resource Streams allow you to include data from the files as byte arrays in your code. An example of its use is in the [ZMachine Demo](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/blob/5973a3fae95c989dc13505184aff9a15aae9f65f/Demos/ZMachine/ZKernel/Kernel.cs#L19) 

## How to use
1. Set for the the file you want to use `Build As: Embedded Resource` using the File Properties window in VS.

2. In the code reference the file using the following format (a static byte array with the attribute):
```
[ManifestResourceStream(ResourceName = “{project_name}.{path}.{to}.{filename_with_extension}”)] 
static byte[] file;
```
The field _must_ be static but the name of the field can be changed. You will also need to add `using IL2CPU.API.Attribs;` to the code.
For example, if the project is called Kernel and the file is `Data\Text.txt`, then `ResourceName = "Kernel.Data.Text.txt"`.

3. To access the data simply read from the byte array defined.
