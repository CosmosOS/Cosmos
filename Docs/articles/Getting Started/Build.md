 1. Start Visual Studio 2019 and create a new project with the type of "Cosmos Kernel". Make sure to select your preferred coding language (C# / VB.Net / F#).
 2. Choose a cool name for your future OS, make sure not to use any white spaces in the name as it may create compiling issues later on. 
 3. Wait patiently for VS to load your new Cosmos project, this process can take up to 5(!) minutes.
 4. Click on the "Start" button (green triangle) and wait for Cosmos to build. This also may take some time.
 5. The building is done, Your OS will run on a new VMware window.
