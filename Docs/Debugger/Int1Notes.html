            A breakpoint is a mechanism to pause a program execution for further analysis 
            during runtime to identify run-time errors. Pausing is required to examine the 
            run-time values of variables. Examining these variables is possible only if they 
            are valid in the current context. Various options will be provided for developer 
            by debugger to examine the details of running program to identify run-time 
            errors including CPU registers, call stack, memory dump and other debugger 
            supported features.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; ">
            <strong>x86 Hardware provided</strong></p>
        <p>
            x86 architecture provides interrupt INT 1, INT 3 and Debug registers which helps 
            debuggers to implement breakpoints.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            <strong>INT 1 – 0xCD01 :</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Single 
            step interrupt provided by x86, where program can be debugged single instruction 
            at a time. This handler is implemented by operating system and provides high 
            level API for debugger development.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            To perform single step on process, debugger need to attach with admin privilege. 
            Debugger need to set Trap Flag (TF) in EFLAGS register. By enabling this flag, 
            debugger gets control from the CPU before executing each instruction. Debugger 
            will give control to developer either in assembly instructions or source code 
            level if it has debugging information. Debugger will give various options for 
            developer for continuing the execution of code after examining the variable 
            values.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            Trap Flag(TF) is fully under control of Debugger, it can enable or disable this 
            flag based on various options provided by debugger including software and 
            conditional breakpoints.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            <strong>INT 3 – 0xCC :</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Break 
            point interrupt is provided by x86, where debugger can place this anywhere 
            inside the program execution. This opcode 0xCC can be placed by developer 
            directly inside a program ( ex: __asm int 3 in a C/C++ code ), this instruction 
            will be identified by CPU during execution of a program and transfers control to 
            a debugger if its running. If the program is not running inside a program, 
            operating system will execute default handler i.e to terminate the program.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            Opcode 0xCC can be used by IDE debugger to implement software based breakpoints. 
            If a developer inserts IDE based breakpoint, internally IDE can this one byte 
            instruction in the code, once IDE gets control from CPU, it will remove this one 
            byte instruction and replace with original instruction and allow developer to 
            examine the program variables. One byte opcode will make easy to insert 
            instruction anywhere in program without much difficulty.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            <strong>Debugger Registers:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong>x86 
            provides 8 debug registers DB0 to DB7 and 2 model specific registers (MSR). 
            These registers can store either memory address or I/O locations to break the 
            execution for analysis of a program in a debugger. To perform action on these 
            registers modifier code must be running kernel mode.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; ">
            Only 4 registers can be used to store the memory location address to pause the 
            execution i.e DRO to DR3, Each of these registers stores the memory address.&nbsp; 
            After the debugger assigns the memory address, based on the address CPU will 
            automatically pause the execution and provide the control to the debugger to 
            help developer to examine the state of the program.&nbsp; These 4 registers 
            functions based on flags set at DR6 and DR7 registers. DR6 is used as status 
            register and DR7 is used as control register. DR6 flags will not be cleared by 
            CPU, callback program need to clear the stack and this will happen only after 
            exception handler gets the control.</p>
        <p>
            DR6 has following flags:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bit 0 to 3 (Breakpoint condition detected): Each of this bit indicated which DR 
                register has triggered breakpoint. If bit 0 is set, it means breakpoint is set 
                using DR0 register.</li>
            <li>Bit 13 (Debug register detected): This bit indicates next instruction in the 
                execution flow is going to access the debug registers from DR0 to DR7.</li>
            <li>Bit 14 (Single Step): This bit indicates that debug exception has generated 
                since Trap Flag (TF) is set in EFLAGS register.</li>
            <li>Bit 15 (Task Switch): This bit indicates debug exception if triggered from a 
                task switch where Trap Flag (TF) is set.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            DR7 register is used as control register. This register will enable or disable 
            breakpoints with breakpoint conditions. This register has following flags:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bit 0, 2, 4 and 6 (Local Breakpoint): These bits enable the breakpoint for 
                current task. After breakpoint exception, CPU will clear this flag to prevent 
                breakpoint in other task.</li>
            <li>Bit 1, 3, 5 and 7 (Global breakpoint): These bits enable the breakpoint in all 
                tasks in the system, after breakpoint exception CPU will not clear this flag to 
                break in any task globally.</li>
            <li>Bit 13 (General detect enable): This bit enables debug register protection which 
                causes a debug exception before executing MOV instruction to move data to debug 
                registers.</li>
            <li>Bit 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28 and 29 (Read/Write): This flag specifies a 
                condition for each breakpoint. Debug Extension (DE) flag in control register CR4 
                determines how to interpret these flags. DE flag has following types:<ol>
                    <li>00 – Break on instruction execution only</li>
                    <li>01 – Break on data writes only</li>
                    <li>10 – Break on I/O reads or writes</li>
                    <li>11 – Break on data reads or writes but not instruction fetches</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Bit 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30 and 31 : These bits helps in identifying the size 
                of memory location specified in debug registers with following options:<ol>
                    <li>00 – 1 byte</li>
                    <li>01 – 2 byte</li>
                    <li>10 – undefined</li>
                    <li>11 – 4 byte</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: center; ">
            <strong>Visual Studio C/C++ Breakpoint conditions</strong></p>
        <p>
            Debuggers have a choice to its own software breakpoints with the help of INT 1 
            handler and other operating system supported debugging features. VC++ implements 
            following conditional breakpoints to help</p>
        <p>
            1. Breaking when it reaches a function: Set a breakpoint for a specific function 
            by providing a full function name. If it’s C++ code, then provide along with 
            class name.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70" height="225" 
                src="http://www.yashks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breakpoint_img_11.png" 
                title="breakpoint_img_1" width="502" /></p>
        <p>
            Line number should be relative to Function. Line number which you provide here 
            should have valid code and you cannot mention to any blank line. You need to 
            select programming language if you are debugging program for more than one 
            language.</p>
        <p>
            2. Breaking in a specific Location in a file: You can set a breakpoint to 
            specific line within source file by inserting breakpoint.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71" height="193" 
                src="http://www.yashks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breakpoint_img_21.png" 
                title="breakpoint_img_2" width="502" /></p>
        <p>
            Specify source filename along with line number. This line number is relative to 
            source file. You can also specify different version of source file for this 
            breakpoint.</p>
        <p>
            3. Breaking when it reaches specified Address: You need to mention runtime 
            address of a function. To use this type of breakpoint, you start a debugging 
            with some breakpoint, then go to Dissembler window, look for address and insert 
            breakpoint.</p>
        <p>
            4. Breaking when specified variables changes: You can specify to break at a 
            specific location based on two conditions “Is TRUE” and “Has Changed”.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72" height="203" 
                src="http://www.yashks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breakpoint_img_31.png" 
                title="breakpoint_img_3" width="424" /></p>
        <p>
            If you want to check the condition if some pointer variable is NULL, then enter 
            expression as “ptrBuff == 0″ and check “Is True” option, it breaks it when 
            variable is 0. Enter expression in “Condition” field and check “Has changed” 
            option for breaking into code when expression changes.</p>
        <p>
            5. If you have loop and if you want to break inside loop based on pre-conditions 
            you can use this conditional breakpoint. It provides four options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break always</li>
            <li>Break when hit count is equal to “Some number”</li>
            <li>Break when hit count is multiple of “Some number”</li>
            <li>Break when hit count is greater or equal to “Some number”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73" height="180" 
                src="http://www.yashks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breakpoint_img_41.png" 
                title="breakpoint_img_4" width="408" /></p>
        <p>
            6. Breakpoint filter based on Machine name, ProcessID, ProcessName, ThreadId, 
            ThreadName with combination of one or more conditions using ||, &amp; and !</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74" height="335" 
                src="http://www.yashks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breakpoint_img_51.png" 
                title="breakpoint_img_5" width="412" /></p>
        <p>
            7. You can print TRACE info in debug window along with built-in macro condition. 
            You have option to continue execution automatically or you can execute the macro 
            and break into code.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75" height="360" 
                src="http://www.yashks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/breakpoint_img_61.png"
