# Welcome to the Official Cosmos Documentation</h1>
  
If you're new to Cosmos, welcome! Before you get surf through the API documentation, we highly recommend you visit the website linked below.  
  
While majority of the content in this documentation is up-to-date, this website also includes some articles which have been written over years ago for websites such as www.codeproject.com. They are mostly kept for archival purposes. We prefer newcomers who want to develop their own operating systems to read the API documentation while we update these articles to comply with the current Cosmos project. 

We **strongly** encourage newcomers to Cosmos to have a basic to intermediate proficiency in the [C# language](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp). Having this level of proficiency will significantly enable independent debugging and problem-solving, reducing the need for continuous assistance. There are many tutorials online for understanding classes, methods, and functions.
    
For projects using the Cosmos Virtual File System *(abbr. VFS)* directly, we recommend you use System.IO methods where possible. This is because these were written before much progress was made making .NET assemblies usable. 
  
For a comprehensive set of information about Cosmos, including our ambitions and other links to chat with us or to seek assistance with something not covered in the documentation, please visit the official [Cosmos website](https://www.gocosmos.org/).
