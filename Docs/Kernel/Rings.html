        Surely our security model will evolve as Cosmos evolves. However we need 
        something simple, efficient, and with minimal impact to the users. I feel this 
        is something most operating systems today fail greatly at.</p>
    <p>
        Cosmos will be divided into rings. In some senses they are similar to 
        traditional operating system rings however they are not enforced by hardware and 
        thus do not have the runtime overhead. Instead they are enforced by the compiler 
        and later by the installation system which will verify assemblies are part of 
        installation.</p>
    <p>
        A new assembly level attribute will be created for processing by IL2CPU. If the 
        attribute is not present User Ring is the default.</p>
    <p>
        Rings from highest to lowest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User<ul>
            <li>System<ul>
                <li>Hardware<ul>
                    <li>Core</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Ring Control</h3>
    <p>
        Rings can only access assemblies in the same ring, or the next lower ring.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Core &lt;-- Hardware &lt;-- System &lt;-- User</p>
    <p>
        For example, System can consume classes in Hardware but not Kernel.</p>
    <h3>
        Core Ring</h3>
    <p>
        In the core ring, &quot;anything goes&quot;. This also means that code which does not 
        require such privileges should not exist in the core ring. The core ring should 
        be restricted to code which truly needs such unfettered access.
    </p>
    <p>
        Priviliges that exist only in the core ring:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use of pointers and direct access to memory</li>
        <li>Access to x86 IO ports.</li>
        <li>Explicit assembly language code</li>
        <li>Unsafe code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The core ring includes functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Threading</li>
        <li>Memory management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Assemblies which are part of the core are restricted.</p>
    <p>
        The core ring exposes objects which allow the hardware ring to access memory 
        indirectly, and in a controlled restricted fashion. For example to allow a 
        driver to acccess video RAM, a memory object can be created by the core ring 
        which allows access to only the specific block of memory needed by the video 
        driver.</p>
    <h3>
        Hardware Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The hardware ring contains drivers and code for accessing hardware via more 
        generic objects exposed by the kernel ring.</p>
    <p>
        The hardware ring includes functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IDE</li>
        <li>SATA</li>
        <li>Ethernet</li>
        <li>USB Controller</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The hardware ring may be further split into two levels at a later date. For 
        example, a driver may exist for the USB Controller and it would require access 
        to the core ring. But drivers implementing USB devices do not need to talk to 
        hardware directly, but instead talk to the USB Controller driver.</p>
    <h3>
        System Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The system ring contains code which builds functionality on top of hardware or 
        other system assemblies.</p>
    <p>
        The system ring includes functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>File systems</li>
        <li>TCP/IP</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        User Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The user ring is compromised of all user code including applications and 
        services.</p>
