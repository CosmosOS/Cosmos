    <p>
        Plugs are used to fill &quot;holes&quot; in .NET libraries and replace them with different 
        code. Holes exist for example when a method in .NET library uses a Windows API 
        call. That API call will not be available on Cosmos. One method would be to 
        emulate the Windows API as WINE does, but the API is a low level C style API 
        relying on memory structures. Emulating it would be highly inefficient. Instead, 
        Cosmos replaces specific methods and property implementations that rely on 
        Windows API calls. Plugs can also be used to provide an alternate implementation 
        for a method, even if it does not rely on the Windows API.</p>
    <p>
        Plugs can be implemented in the following manners:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code Plug - Standard C# (or any .NET language) is used to provide the alternate 
            implementation.</li>
        <li>Assembly Languge - In a few low level cases assembly language is used. This is 
            reserved for a few few cases and only allowed in the Cosmos.Core ring.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When a Cosmos project is compiled, IL2CPU creates a list of plugs. When it 
        encounters a method or property for which a plug exists, instead of using the IL 
        contained in the existing implementation, it substitutes the plug version 
        instead.</p>
    <h3>
        Plug Targets</h3>
    <p>
        Plugs can be applied to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non Source Targets (A class library without modifiable or available source) - 
            For example the Console class in the .NET Framework. The Console class uses the 
            Windows API, so plugs can be used to redefine the methods in the Console class 
            to use code which interacts with Cosmos instead. For these types of plug 
            targets, the attributes are specified on the plug implemenation since the source 
            cannot be modified of the target. If we coud modify the source, we wouldn&#39;t need 
            plugs. :)</li>
        <li>Source Targets - Empty methods which create a sort of &quot;abstract&quot; class are used 
            to define an interface to an assembly language plug. This type of plug is rare 
            and only for the core ring. For these types of plugs, the attributes are 
            specified on the target, rather than the implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Non source targets should never need to use assembly language, but if they do 
        the plugs must be cascaded since assembly language plugs can only be applied to 
        classes with modifiable source.</p>
    <h3>
        Implementing a Plug</h3>
    <p>
        Plugs can be applied at the class, or to an individual method or property. Plug 
        implementations are defined by applying attributes to the class which provides 
        the plug implementation.</p>
    <h3>
        Plug Assembly Naming in Cosmos</h3>
    <p>
        Plugs assemblies in Cosmos are named in the following manner.</p>
    <p>
        Cosmos.&lt;ring&gt;.Plugs.&lt;Unique section of target namespace&gt;</p>
    <p>
        ie Cosmos.System.Plugs.System</p>
    <p>
        Normally only one section will exist after plugs, but mutliple sections could 
        exist to further seperate a group of plugs into multiple assemblies. In the 
        previous example we can determine the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cosmos</b>.System.Plugs.System - All Cosmos assemblies start with Cosmos.*. 
            User assemblies should not use the Cosmos. prefix.</li>
        <li>Cosmos.<b>System</b>.Plugs.System - The plugs are part of the System ring.</li>
        <li>Cosmos.System.<b>Plugs</b>.System - Plugs seperates plugs from normal code with 
            in the Cosmos.System.*</li>
        <li>Cosmos.System.Plugs.<b>System</b> - The plugs in this assembly will apply to 
            System.*. It could also be System.Collections for example to apply to 
            System.Collections.*</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Plugs should be implemented in the highest ring possible and according to the 
        code in the plug, not according to the class to which the plug targets. Most 
        plugs should be in fact in the system ring. Except for a few special plugs 
        needed by the compiler, off hand I cannot think of any that should be 
        implemented in any ring lower than the system ring.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Plug Target</b></p>
    <p>
        Please specify the PlugTarget using the fully qualified name, like: 
        global::System.Console. To avoid later name colisions.</p>
