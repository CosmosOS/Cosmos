<hr/>

Cosmos (C# Open Source Managed Operating System) is an operating system development kit which uses .NET, alongside the custom IL2CPU compiler to convert (most) C# code into a working bare-metal OS.
Despite C# in the name, any .NET-based language can be used, which includes: VB.NET, IronPython, F# and more. Cosmos itself and its kernel routines are primarily written in C#, and thus the Cosmos name.

In a project, Cosmos can be thought of as a compiler and a sort-of standard library for a project. It gives the user access to often hard to find or otherwise difficult to understand tools.

## Features

The following is a non-exhaustive list of features that Cosmos offers:

- Low level assembly access and pointer memory control
- A basic (and unstable at the moment) filesystem
- Most features found in the .NET core library
- A CPU/FPU accelerated math library
- A basic graphics interface
- A basic network interface
- A basic audio interface

> **Note**

> Use [embeded resources](https://cosmosos.github.io/articles/Kernel/ManifestResouceStream.html) instead of the FS for now.
