<hr/>

Cosmos (C# Open Source Managed Operating System) is an operating system development kit which uses .NET, alongside the custom IL2CPU compiler to convert (most) C# code into a working bare-metal OS.
Despite C# in the name, any .NET-based language can be used, which includes: VB.NET, IronPython, F# and more. Cosmos itself and its kernel routines are primarily written in C#, and thus the Cosmos name.

In a project, Cosmos can be thought of as a compiler and a sort-of standard library for a project. It gives the user access to often hard to find or otherwise difficult to understand tools.

## Reporting an issue

If you think you found a bug in Cosmos, please check existing [issues](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/issues) first before opening a new one. Do **not** open an issue if you need help with something in Cosmos that is not a bug, if you don't know how to code it's not a Cosmos issue for example.
