            Cosmos.Debug.Kernel is a special assembly and is not in any ring. It can also be 
            accessed from any ring. Special care must be kept to keep only debugging 
            functions in this assembly, and not to allow such ringless behaviour to be 
            implemented in other assemblies.</p>
        <p>
            Cosmos.Debug.Kernel must not contain any references to any kernel units. All 
            references from kernel units must be incoming only.</p>
