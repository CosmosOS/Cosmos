            Despite it being named kernel, it is not the Cosmos kernel. It is instead an 
            interface to control the state of the kernel regarding booting, restarting, 
            shutting down etc. Despite an exhaustive search, we could not determine a more 
            appropriate name and settled on Kernel, since it is a system level interface to 
            the kernel.</p>
