            Dynamically loaded drivers are contained in this folder. In the future they may 
            be in different assemblies which are loaded on demand. The drivers in the root 
            folder are not dynamic, and are drivers that are required for all systems, or 
            are common bases used by dynamic drivers. For example, ATA exists in the root, 
            but actual ATA chipsets should exist in this directory.</p>
