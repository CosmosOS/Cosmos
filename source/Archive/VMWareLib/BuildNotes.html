            VIX API</h3>
        <p>
            Akward API with COM options, but only C examples provided by VMWare. Thus the 
            desire to use this class lib.</p>
        <h3>
            VMRun.exe</h3>
        <p>
            VMRun will let us stop VMWare but not close it. Not critical, but I already had 
            VMWareLib working by the time I discovered vmrun. VMWareLib adds a lot of extra 
            code, but in future we might do more with VMWare and it allows us more power 
            than VMRun.</p>

        <p>
            Original project used a brittle custom MS build project which had several 
            external dependencies. It has been stripped down to a single project that we 
            need and used here.</p>

            Other notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Must be x86 because the com object is x86.</li>
            <li>Added a strong name key because our referrers are strong named and therefore 
                required it.</li>
            <li>interop.vixcom.constants cannot be embedded<ul>
