Cosmos is an operating system "construction kit", built from the ground up around the IL2CPU compiler in C# and our home-brewed language called X#.

It's current stage is only usable for academic work. Some day Cosmos will be ready for production work, but to reach that stage we need more developers. Specifically, we need a few more low-level developers to help the few core developers who are currently overwhelmed with work.


Downloads:
---------

Cosmos is available in two flavors:
* **User Kit** - The User Kit is used to develop your operating system in Visual Studio.
  If you are new to Cosmos, you can learn [here](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/wiki). [Latest Release available.](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/releases/latest)
* **Development Kit (Devkit)** - The Development Kit is the full Cosmos source and build tools.
  If you need to modify the Cosmos core functions or modify built-in drivers, boot, compiler, etc.. you will need to use Development Kit.
  [Tutorial for building the Development Kit](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/wiki/Devkit) - Building from the source is easy with our automated builder.
