### C# Open Source Managed Operating System

[We are currently migrating from codeplex](http://cosmos.codeplex.com/)

Cosmos is an operating system "construction kit", built from the ground up around the IL2CPU compiler in C# and our home-brewed language called X#.

It's current stage is only usable for academic work. Some day Cosmos will be ready for production work, but to reach that stage we need more developers. Specifically, we need a few more low level developers to help the few core developers who are currently overwhelmed with work.


Download
---------

Cosmos is available in two forms:
* **User Kit** - User Kit allows you to develop your own custom operating system in Visual Studio. 
  If you are new to Cosmos, [start here](http://cosmos.codeplex.com/documentation). [Latest Release](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/releases/latest)
* **Dev Kit** - Dev Kit is the full Cosmos source with build tools. 
  If you need to modify core Cosmos functions or modify built in drivers, boot, compiler, etc then you will need to use Dev Kit.
  [How to build the Dev Kit](https://cosmos.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Building%20Dev%20Kit&referringTitle=Devkit#) - Building from source is easy with our automated builder.
