CosmosOS is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in. Join the team!

- Before you begin work, make sure to discuss it with the maintainers here on github or on discord. It will save a lot of time down the road.
- Fork the project over to your account, do not request repository access.
- Please be sure to check out the FAQ to see if any questions you have are already answered. [FAQ on GoCosmos.org](https://www.gocosmos.org/faq/)
- Please don't "bump" your issue(s). If you've filed it, we have seen it.
- If you have any questions or need a bit of help feel free to open a discussion post or ask on the discord.
