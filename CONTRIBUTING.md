CosmosOS is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in. Join the team!

- Before you begin work, make sure to clear it with the project owners. It will save a lot of time down the road.
- Fork the project over to your account, do not request repository access.
- Please be sure to check out the FAQ to see if any questions you have are already answered. [FAQ on GoCosmos.org](https://www.gocosmos.org/faq/)
- Please don't "bump" your issue(s). If you've filed it, we have seen it.
- Please be sure to install the [EditorConfig](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c8bccfe2-650c-4b42-bc5c-845e21f96328). This ensures your pull requests meet the required formatting and conventions. [See here](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/wiki/FAQ#what-is-this-editorconfig-file-and-how-do-i-use-it) for more info.
