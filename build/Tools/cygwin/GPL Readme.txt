GPL is a viral license.

However we only call these as EXEs and do not wrap them in a reusable exportable manner. We simply call these EXEs to perform the tasks they are built for as a small stage of our build. This is legal under GPL.

If it wasn't, no user could run any GPL based EXE on any non GPL based OS.

Use of such an EXE does not require Cosmos to be GPL.
