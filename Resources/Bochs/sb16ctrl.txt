# first, reset the translation table with command 'r'
r

# then load a few translations.
# The format is:
# t OldBankMSB OldBankLSB OldProgram NewBankMSB NewBankLSB NewProgram
#
# All values are in the range of 0-127 or 255.
# For old values, 255 means "match any".
# For new values, 255 means "don't change".
#
# When deciding whether a program change is to be remapped, these
# remappings are checked first to last, and the first applicable remap
# is used.

# This would map all bank changes to bank 0/0
# t 255 255 255	0 0 255
# it's commented out, otherwise none of the below changes would
# be checked, as this one matches anything.

t 255 255 0	0 0 19	# remap piano to church organ
t 255 255 255 	0 0 0	# everything remaining -> piano

# now show the number of translations that have been loaded
i 3

# and enable GS/GM mode
m 0xF0,0x41,0x10,0x42,0x12,0x40,0x00,0x7F,0x00,0x41,0xF7
