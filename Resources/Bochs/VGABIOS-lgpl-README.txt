Plex86/Bochs VGABios
--------------------

The goal of this project is to have a LGPL'd Video Bios in plex86,
Bochs and qemu.
This VGA Bios is very specific to the emulated VGA card.
It is NOT meant to drive a physical vga card.


Cirrus SVGA extension
---------------------

The Cirrus SVGA extension is designed for the Cirrus emulation in Bochs and
qemu. The initial patch for the Cirrus extension has been written by Makoto
Suzuki (suzu).


Install
-------
To compile the VGA Bios you will need :
- gcc
- bcc
- as86
- ld86

Untar the archive, and type make. You should get a "VGABIOS-lgpl-latest.bin"
file. Alternatively, you can use the binary file "VGABIOS-lgpl-latest.bin",
i have compiled for you.

Edit your plex86/bochs conf file, and modify the load-rom command in the
VGA BIOS section, to point to the new vgabios image file.


Debugging
---------
You can get a very basic debugging system: messages printed by the vgabios.
You have to register the "unmapped" device driver in plex86 or bochs, and make
sure it grabs port 0xfff0.

Comment the #undef DEBUG at the beginning of vgabios.c.
You can then use the "printf" function in the bios.


Testing
-------
Look at the "testvga.c" file in the archive. This is a minimal Turbo C 2.0
source file that calls a few int10 functions. Feel free to modify it to suit
your needs.

Reverse Engineering
-------------------
The VGA Bios has been written without reverse-engineering any existing Bios.
