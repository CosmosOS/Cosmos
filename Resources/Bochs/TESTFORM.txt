BOCHS TESTING FORM Version 0.6
-------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the variety of platforms and configurations that Bochs
supports, it is difficult for any one person to test it thoroughly.
This form is intended to help the Bochs developers keep track of test
results from different sources.  To avoid confusion, this form should
be submitted once for each combination of host OS and guest OS you
try.  For example: your host OS is Debian Linux and you get both Win95
and FreeDOS to start up.  You would send one form for
Win95-under-Debian and a second form for FreeDOS-under-Debian.  In
this case it would save time to fill in the host OS part, copy it a
few times and fill out the guest OS part for each copy.

To fill in a blank such as [__], replace the underlines and leave
the brackets.  Example: [Sun Ultrasparc 10].  To fill in a
multiple-choice, just put an X in the brackets.  Example: [X]
