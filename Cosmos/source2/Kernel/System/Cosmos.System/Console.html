            TextScreen is stateless and &quot;raw on hardware&quot;. This Console class can track 
            state and eventually may handle virtual screens etc. Because of this it is not 
            static, but the default one is created in System.Global. This is separate from 
            the plugged Console as it cannot hold any state. The plugged Console writes to 
            the default, but later a global var can be changed to allow it output to 
            differnet virtual ones based on process ID, etc.</p>
        <p>
            This is a writing / scrolling class // A different class will be created for 
            fixed positioning (can use TextScreen for now). // Mixing writing with fixed 
            position just creates a mess, and would interefere with scroll // back 
            capabilities etc.</p>
