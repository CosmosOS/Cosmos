      Building a VS Tool Window package is easy. Deploying it apparently is not, and 
      because we deploy even at dev time with a setup.exe, we need to deploy it. VS 
      Tool Window packages use WPF UserControls though, so for now we use this 
      separate standalone EXE which uses WPF UserControls.</p>

      This is also easier to debug because it can just be rebuilt without affecting 
      Visual Studio. Maybe in the future the VSIP package can just reference this 
      package to and use the user controls, so for debugging and development of this 
      project, it could be used instead.</p>

      For nearly all purposes this is better than our GDB client and nearly deprecates 
      our GDB client. However our GDB client is important to retain for debuggin the 
      DebugStub. DebugStub cannot debug itself, and even if it could, if its not 
      working correctly then neither would this debug tool as it relies on DebugStub.</p>
