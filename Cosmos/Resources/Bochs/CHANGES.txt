Changes in 2.5 (November 27, 2011):

         Bochs repository moved to the SVN version control !

Brief summary :

! Fully configurable CPU to emulate with a single .bochsrc option !
- 10% (ST) to 50% (SMP) CPU emulation speedup !
- Implemented support for new x86 ISA extensions, Bochs is aligned with
  latest published Intel Architecture Manual (rev 040, AVX rev 011):
     - XSAVEOPT, AVX/AVX2/FMA/F16C, BMI1/BMI2, SMEP, INVPCID, TSC-Deadline
     - VMX: VMX Preemption Timer, Pause Loop Exiting and VM Functions
- Implemented support for AMD SSE4A/XOP/FMA4/TBM instruction sets
- Networking: introduced new networking module 'slirp'
- Harddrive: fixed buffer overflow causing Bochs crash in LBA48 mode
- VGA: Added PCI ROM support to cirrus and pcivga and moved ROM loading
       for the ISA case to the vga code (SeaBIOS now usable by Bochs)
- Sound: ported ES1370 soundcard emulation from Qemu
- Continuing configure rework, check for more removed configure and .bochsrc
  options and their replacements !
- LGPL'd VGABIOS updated to version 0.7a

Detailed change log :

- CPU
  - Now you can configure CPU to emulate using a single .bochsrc option !
    The option selects CPU configuration to emulate from pre-defined list
    of supported configurations. When this option is used, Bochs CPU emulation
    engine is automatically configured to emulate a specific real hardware CPU,
    including exact CPUID matching reference hardware. Check .bochsrc example
    or check user manual for list of supported configurations and more details.
  * It is also possible to choose the CPU to emulate from Bochs command line
    using command line interface to .bochsrc: "cpu::model <cpu_name>"
  * Query for supported CPU models using command line option: -help cpu.

  - 10% emulation speedup with handlers chaining optimization implemented. The
    feature is enabled by default when configure with --enable-all-optimizations
    option, to disable handlers chaining speedups configure with
        --disable-handlers-chaining
  - New way of CPUs scheduling in SMP mode brings up to 50% speedup to the
    SMP emulation. New implementation uses dynamic CPU quantum value and takes
    full advantage of the trace cache. Each emulated processor will execute
    the whole trace before switching to the next processor.
  * It is also safe to use large (up to 16 instructions) quantum values for
    the SMP emulation now and improve performance even further.

  - Implemented Supervisor Mode Execution Protection (SMEP), the feature can
    be enabled using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Added support for XSAVEOPT instruction, the instruction can be enabled
    using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Added support for AVX and AVX2 instructions emulation, to enable configure
    with --enable-avx option. When compiled in, AVX still has to be enabled
    using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Added emulation of AVX float16 convert instructions, the feature can be
    enabled using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Added support for AVX2 FMA instructions emulation. The implementation
    was ported (with few bugfixes) from QEMU patch by Peter Maydell.
    The FMA instructions support can be enabled using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Added support for Bit Manipulation Instructions (BMI1/BMI2) emulation.
    The BMI instructions support can be enabled using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Added support for AMD SSE4A/XOP/FMA4/TBM extensions emulation, the
    instructions can be enabled using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - Implemented VMX preemption timer VMEXIT control (patch by Jianan Hao)
  - Implemented Pause-Loop Exiting Secondary VMEXIT control.
  - Implemented VM Functions support and EPTP-Switching VM Function.
  - Added INVPCID instruction emulation support.
  - Added APIC timer TSC-Deadline mode emulation support.
  - Now you could disable x86-64 from .bochsrc so it become possible to
    emulate 32-bit CPUs using Bochs binary compiled with x86-64 support.
  - Updated/fixed instrumentation callbacks.
  - Bugfixes for CPU emulation correctness and stability.

- Bochs Internal Debugger and Debugger GUI
  - Bochs disassembler fixes / new instructions support.
  - Fixed timer breakpoint handling in Bochs internal debugger.
  - Fixed bug in Bochs internal debugger 'show off' command.
  - Added Bochs internal debugger command 'vmexitbp' to set breakpoint on
    VMX guest VMEXIT (patch by Jianan Hao). Type 'vmexitbp' in debugger
    command window to switch it on/off (similar to modebp).
  - Fixed linear to physical address translation by Bochs internal debugger
    for EPT unrestricted guest (VMX guest with paging disabled under EPT)
  - Fixed bug in GUI debugger SSE registers display.
  - Correctly display current CPU mode in GUI debugger status bar.
  - Turn off the mouse capture when the internal debugger or gdbstub enter
    the input loop.

- Memory
  - Added new configure option which enables RAM file backing for large guest
    memory with a smaller amount host memory, without causing a panic when
    host memory is exhausted (patch by Gary Cameron). To enable configure with
        --enable-large-ramfile option.

- Configure and compile
  - Fixed Bochs manifest for Win64 compilation using Microsoft Visual Studio
    command line compiler.
  - Added ability to configure CPUID family through .bochsrc.
    The default family value determined by configure option --enable-cpu-level.
  - Added ability to configure CPUID model through .bochsrc.
    The default model value is 3.
  - Added ability to configure x2apic support through .bochsrc.
    The APIC configuration could be selected using new CPUID .bochsrc APIC option.
    Possible configurations are: "legacy", "xapic" and "x2apic".
    Configure option --enable-x2apic and Bochs 2.4.6 .bochsrc XAPIC option are
    deprecated and should not be used anymore.
  - Configure option --enable-vbe is deprecated and should not be used anymore.
    The VBE support is always automatically compiled in, in order to enable
    VBE support the .bochsrc option "vga: extension=" has to be set to "vbe".
    If PCI is present, the "pcivga" device can be assigned to PCI slot.
  - Configure option --enable-acpi is deprecated and should not be used anymore.
    The ACPI support is always automatically compiled in if PCI is compiled in.
    The ACPI still could be disabled using .bochsrc 'plugin_ctrl' option.
  - Removed --enable-trace-cache configure option. The option will be always ON
    for any Bochs configuration.
  - Compile in MONITOR/MWAIT support by default for all cpu-level=6 configurations.
  - added support for MSVC DLL plugins with a separate workspace package.
    VS2008Ex can now create a BOCHS.EXE with a set of plugin DLLs.
    TODO: nmake still cannot create plugin DLLs.
  - removed some outdated / unmaintained parts from the Bochs code: BeOS host
    support, plex86 support, networking module 'arpback', text snapshot check
    feature.

- I/O Devices
  - Networking
    - new networking module 'slirp' (user mode networking using Slirp and a
      builtin DHCP server)
  - Hard drive / cdrom
    - fixed buffer overflow causing Bochs crash in LBA48 mode
    - implemented ATA commands "READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS" and
      "READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS EXT"
  - Sound
    - ported ES1370 soundcard emulation from Qemu, to enable configure with
      the option --enable-es1370
    - sound input implemented in the sound lowlevel modules for Windows and
      Linux (ALSA / OSS)
  - PCI
    - added framework for PCI ROM support
    - new bochsrc option 'pci' replaces the 'i440fxsupport' option. The 'chipset'
      parameter for now only accepts the value 'i440fx'.
  - VGA
    - added PCI ROM support to cirrus and pcivga and moved ROM loading for the ISA
      case to the vga code (SeaBIOS now usable by Bochs)
    - log prefix now depends on the selected extension (new prefix BXVGA for
      Bochs VBE support)
  - USB
    - experimental USB xHCI support (written by Ben Lunt)

  - LGPL'd VGABIOS updated to version 0.7a
    - implemented vgabios functions with AX=0x112x (patch by Hugo Mercier)
    - fixed DAC palette in 8 bpp VBE and Cirrus modes (using the same palette
      as VGA mode 0x13)
    - VBE: added HDTV resolutions (patch by Tristan Schmelcher)
    - VBE: added PCI ROM signature and data structure

  - ROM BIOS
    - Report memory above 4GB to BIOS (patch by Sebastian Herbszt)
    - added PCI ROM init code for BIOS-bochs-latest
      (WARNING: legacy BIOS no longer works with a PCI display adapter)

- GUI and display libraries
  - new parameter 'update_freq' for the 'vga' bochsrc option replaces the
    'vga_update_interval' option
  - vga update frequency now uses host timing if the realtime synchronization
    is enabled with the "clock" option (FIXME: it should always be used -
    independent from the "clock" setting)
  - Implemented graphics mode snapshot for VBE, Cirrus and standard VGA modes.
    CGA modes are not supported yet.
  - added 'x' display library option 'nokeyrepeat' to turn off keyboard repeat

- Config interface
  - win32paramdlg: dialog size now adjusted to support larger label text
  - win32paramdlg: added tooltip support using the parameter description

  - Support for > 32 bit physical address space in CPU. Up to 36 bit could be
    seen in legacy mode (PAE) and up to 40 bit in x86-64 mode.
    Still support the same amount of the physical memory in the memory object,
    so system with > 4Gb of RAM yet cannot be emulated.
    To enable configure with --enable-long-phy-address option.
  - Implemented modern BIOSes mode limiting max reported CPUID function
    to 3 using .bochsrc CPU option. The mode is required in order to
    correctly install and boot WinNT.
  - Added ability to configure CPUID vendor/brand strings through .bochsrc
    (patch from @SF by Doug Reed).
  - Many bugfixes for CPU emulation correctness (both x86 and x86-64).
  - Updated CPU instrumentation callbacks.
  - Fixed Bochs internal debugger breakpoints/watchpoints handling.

- Configure and compile
  - Added ability to choose Bochs log file name and Bochs debugger log file
    name from Bochs command line (using new -log and -dbglog options)
  - Removed Peter Tattam's closed source external debugger interface from
    the code.
  - Removed --enable-guest2host-tlb configure option. The option is always
    enabled for any Bochs configuration.
  - Removed --enable-icache configure option. The option is always enabled
    for any Bochs configuration. Trace cache support still remains optional
    and could be configured off.
  - Added configure option to compile in GUI frontend for Bochs debugger,
    to enable configure with --enable-debugger-gui option.
    The GUI debugger frontend is enabled by default with Bochs debugger.
  - Removed --enable-port-e9-hack configure option. The feature now could be
    configured at runtime through .bochsrc.
  - Added configure option to enable/disable A20 pin support. Disabling the
    A20 pin support slightly speeds up the emulation.
  - reduced dependencies between source files for faster code generation

- BIOS
  - Added S3 (suspend to RAM) ACPI state to BIOS (patch by Gleb Natapov)
  - Implemented MTRR support in the bios (patches by Avi Kivity and Alex
    Williamsion with additions by Sebastian Herbszt)
  - Bug fixes

- I/O Devices
  - Added user plugin support
  - remaining devices converted to plugins: pit, ioapic, iodebug
  - added 'plugin_ctrl' bochsrc option to control the presence of optional
    device plugins without a separate option. By default all plugins are enabled.
  - added register mechanism for removable mouse and keyboard devices
  - Hard drive / cdrom
    - PACKET-DMA feature now supported by all ATAPI commands
    - ATAPI command 0x1A added (based on the Qemu implementation)
  - sb16
    - Added ALSA sound support on Linux (PCM/MIDI output)
    - FM synthesizer now usable with MIDI output (simple piano only)
      - Fixed OPL frequency to MIDI note translation
      - Fixed MIDI output command
  - keyboard
    - added keyboard controller commands 0xCA and 0xCB
  - USB
    - USB code reorganized to support more HC types and devices
    - added USB OHCI support written by Ben Lunt
    - added external USB hub support (initial code ported from Qemu)
    - added USB cdrom support (SCSI layer ported from Qemu)
    - added status bar indicators to show data transfer
  - VGA
    - VBE video memory increased to 16 MB
    - implemented changeable VBE LFB base address (PCI only, requires latest
      BIOS and VGABIOS images)
  - I/O APIC
    - implemented I/O APIC device hardware reset

- Config interface
  - new config interface 'win32config' with start and runtime menu is now
    the default on Windows ('textconfig' is still available)
  - win32 device config dialogs are now created dynamicly from a parameter list
    (works like the wx ParamDialog)
  - changes in textcofig and the wx ParamDialog for compatibility with the new
    win32 dialog behaviour
  - Bochs param tree index keys are case independent now
  - some other additions / bugfixes in the simulator interface code

- Misc
  - updated LGPL'd VGABIOS to version 0.6c
  - Updated Bochs TESTFORM to version 0.4

Changes in 2.3.6 (December 24, 2007):

Brief summary :

+ More than 25% emulation speedup vs Bochs 2.3.5 release!

      - Thanks to Darek Mihocka (http://www.emulators.com)
        for providing patches and ideas that made the
        speedup possible!

+ Up to 40% speedup vs Bochs 2.3.5 release with trace cache optimization!

- Lots of bugfixes in CPU emulation
- Bochs benchmarking support
- Added emulation of Intel SSE4.2 instruction set

Detailed change log :

- CPU
  - Added emulation of SSE4.2 instruction set, to enable use
        --enable-sse=4 --enable-sse-extension configure options
    to enable POPCNT instruction only use configure option
        --enable-popcnt
  - Implemented MTRR emulation, to enable use --enable-mtrr configure
    option. MTRRs is enabled by default when cpu-level >= 6.
  - Implemented experimental MONITOR/MWAIT support including optimized
    MWAIT CPU state and hardware monitoring of physical address range,
    to enable use --enable-monitor-mwait configure option.
  - Removed hostasm optimizations, after Bochs rebenchmarking it was found
    that the feature bringing no speedup or even sometimes slows down
    emulation!
  - Merged trace cache optimization patch, the trace cache optimization
    is enabled by default when configure with --enable-all-optimizations
    option, to disable trace cache optimization configure with
        --disable-trace-cache
  - Many minor bugfixes in CPU emulation (both ia32 and x86-64)
  - Updated CPU instrumentation callbacks

- Bochs Internal Debugger and Disassembler
  - Many fixes in Bochs internal debugger and disassembler, some debugger
    interfaces significantly changed due transition to the param tree
    architecture
  - Added support for restoring of the CPU state from external file
    directly from Bochs debugger

- Configure and compile
  - Renamed configure option --enable-4meg-pages to --enable-large-pages.
    The option enables page size extensions (PSE) which refers to 2M pages
    as well.
  - Removed --enable-save-restore configure option, save/restore feature
    changed to be one of the basic Bochs features and compiled by default
    for all configurations.
  - Added new Bochs benchmark mode. To run Bochs in benchmark mode execute
    it with new command line option 'bochs -benchmark time'. The emulation
    will be automatically stopped after 'time' millions of emulation
    cycles executed.
  - Another very useful option for benchmarking of Bochs could be enabled
    using new 'print_timestamps' directive from .bochsrc:
        print_timestamps: enable=1
  - Added --enable-show-ips option to all configuration scripts used to
    build release binaries, so all future releases will enjoy IPS display.
  - Enable alignment check in the CPU and #AC exception by default for
    --cpu-level >= 4 (like in real hardware)

Changes in 2.1 (January 9, 2004):

Brief summary :
- New disassembler
- 3DNow!/SSE/SSE2/PNI instruction support
- Vmware3/Sparse/Undoable/Growing harddisk images support
- many VGA emulation improvements (e.g. high/true color VBE modes added)
- No more X11 vga font required

Detailed change log :

- CPU
  - added emulation of AMD 3DNow! instructions set. (Stanislav Shwartsman)
    Bochs now could decode all AMD 3DNow! instructions.
    Most of instructions still not implemented, but the basis already presents.
    Configure --enable-3dnow to enable 3DNow! support.
    Notes :
      - These instructions are not implemented yet:
	PFPNACC_PqQq, PF2IW_PqQq, PFNACC_PqQq, PFCMPGE_PqQq, PFMIN_PqQq,
	PFRCP_PqQq, PFRSQRT_PqQq, PFSUB_PqQq, PFADD_PqQq, PFCMPGT_PqQq,
	PFMAX_PqQq, PFRCPIT1_PqQq, PFRSQIT1_PqQq, PFSUBR_PqQq, PFACC_PqQq,
	PFCMPEQ_PqQq, PFMUL_PqQq, PFRCPIT2_PqQq
     - CPUID does not report 3DNow! instruction set.
  - added emulation of SSE/SSE2 floating point instructions. (Stanislav)
    All SSE/SSE2 floating point instructions are fully implemented using
    free softfloat library (including DAZ support and floating point
    exceptions). Correctness of the emulation checked with heavily random
    testing.
  - added emulation of SSE3 (PNI) instructions (Stanislav)
    Currently only 3 PNI opcodes still not implemented:
	FISTTP m16int, FISTTP m32int, FISTTP m64int
  - added P4 CPU support to CPUID instruction. (Stanislav)
  - fixed implementation of FXSAVE/FXRSTOR instructions. (Stanislav)
  - bugfix: unallowed lock prefix cases must cause #UD exception. (Stanislav)
  - fixed fetchdecode bug caused #UD in SYSENTER/SYSEXIT instructions
    in 32bit mode. (Stanislav)
  - fixed fetchdecode64 bug caused wrong decoding of opcodes containing
    BxImmediate_IvIw or BxImmediate_IwIb in x86-64. (Stanislav)
  - fixed bug in int01 (opcode 0xF1) emulation. (Vitaly Vorobyov)
  - fixed bug in x86 debugger with dr0-dr3 registers (Vitaly)
  - fixed bug with mov to/from dr register in v86mode.
    (now exception is generated (according to Intel documentation)
    instead of panic) (Vitaly)
  - fixed stack limit checking, now message is generated as BX_DEBUG,
    rather then BX_PANIC, and exception code is executed. (Vitaly)
  - instrumentation code updated. (Stanislav)
  - fix flaw in IO bitmap permission of TSS (Christophe Bothamy)
  - cpu resets on triple fault (Christophe)
  - remove calculation on cr3 in dtranslate_linear to increase
    emulation speed (Conn Clark)
  - numerous x86-64 fixes (Peter Tattam)

- FPU
  - hundreds of bugfixes in FPU emulation after checking of the emulation
    with testfloat (Scott Duplichan).
    - Fixed cases:
        - floatx80_to_int32,   floatx80_to_float32
        - floatx80_to_float64, floatx80_round_to_int
        - floatx80_add,        floatx80_sub,
        - floatx80_mul,        floatx80_div
  - implemented FCMOVcc instructions (Stanislav)
  - 64-bit addressing support for x86-64 mode (Peter)

- Disassembler
  - replaced Bochs disassember. New table-based disassembler fully supports
    all IA-32 instruction sets including all FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3 opcodes.
    (Stanislav)

- I/O devices
  - general
    - i/o access mask implemented, unallowed cases are now handled in the devices
      code and cause a BX_ERROR (Volker Ruppert)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 2.0 (December 21, 2002):

Since the change log is hundreds of lines long, here is a very brief summary.
- 2x emulation speedup!!!
- added plugin devices and guis. Now you can compile with many more
  options, and choose between them at runtime.
- added emulation of AMD x86-64, MMX, SSE, SSE2 instructions
- add wxWindows port (a graphical configuration interface and display lib)
  and SVGAlib port (full screen display for Linux without X11)
- improvements in many I/O devices: for example up to 8 hard disks/cdroms,
  TUN/TAP network interface, 360k floppies,
- improved MacOSX/Carbon interface and updated MacOS9 port
- GDB remote stub, allows symbolic debugging with Bochs simulation.
- support for up to 32gig hard disk images

Detailed change log follows.

- documentation
  - manpages updated (Volker, Christophe)
  - install HTML rendering of docbook documentation instead of
    docs-html (Bryce)
  - doc/docbook/Makefile is now generated by configure script.
    if configure detects docbook2html on your system, it will turn on
    --enable-docbook and run make in the doc/docbook directory.  Also
    make install will install documentation into $(docdir).  You can use
    --disable-docbook to turn this off, if necessary. (Bryce)
  - add "make bochsdoc.tar.gz" target to create a documentation tarball.
    If you do "make webinst" and you have write access on SF shell server,
    it updates doc/docbook/* on the website (Bryce)
  - user documentation additions:
    - new options (Bryce, Volker, Christophe)
    - Bios tips section (Christophe)
    - Tuntap section (Christophe)
    - Serial Port section (Christophe)
    - "Will it Work for Me" / "Is Bochs Right for Me" sections
      (N. David Guarneri)
    - VESA section (Jeroen Janssen)
    - several documents, previously existing as separate html files, have
      been included :
      - internal debugger section (Christophe)
      - gdb stub debugger section (Christophe)
      - WinME, WinNT, WinXP, The Hurd, Japanese Win95 install tips (Christophe)
      - Win95, Win98 install tips (N. David)
      - SB16 section (N. David)

- configure script/compile/porting to other OSes/installation
  - added plugin architecture
    - plugin code written by Bryce, Christophe, Volker based on
      plex86's plugin code by Kevin.  Testing help from Psyon and Br'fin.
    - Plugins are shared libraries that can be loaded on demand.  Example:
      the serial device is implemented as a plugin.  In UNIX, the
      serial plugin is called libbx_serial.so.  When Bochs reads its
      configuration file, if the serial device is enabled it loads
      libbx_serial.so.
    - all display libraries, most I/O devices are converted to plugins now
    - plugins supported on Linux, Solaris, and MacOS X using libtool,
      Cygwin using dlltool.  On MacOSX, you must have dlcompat installed
      and in your include/library paths at configure time.  (See .conf.macosx
      for an example.)
    - we use libtool's LTDL library from libtool 1.4.2, with a number of
      critical bug fixes (Bryce Denney)
    - the Linux binary RPMs are built with plugin support
    - to compile with plugins, configure with --enable-plugins
    - the LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH variable tells Bochs where its plugins can be
      found.  Bochs has a compile-time default for this variable which is
      correct if you do a make install.  You would only need to set the
      variable if the default is wrong.
    - for win32 plugins we added "BOCHSAPI" in front of many classes
      and methods, to aid in building DLLs.  This turns into __declspecs
      which are used when making an export library for Bochs.
  - allow many display libraries to be configured and compiled at
    a time.  For example --with-win32 --with-sdl --with-rfb.
    Also, we added an experimental option --with-all-libs which
    tries to detect which --with-* options will work.  If the
    autodetection fails, just type the --with-* options explicitly. (Bryce)
  - add #if's around all files which are conditionally compiled such
    as cdrom.cc and sb16.cc.  This makes it possible to compile every
    source file all the time, which has the potential to simplify the
    configure script and makefiles.  At present we only take advantage
    of this capability in the win32 VC++ workspace. (Bryce)
  - the MacOS9 port has been updated so that it works again.  It had
    not been updated in at least 2 years, maybe more.  (Christophe Bothamy)
  - improve support for FHS standard (Robert Millan, Volker Ruppert)
    See patches 551811 and 650066.
  - keep separate CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS for Bochs (usually a graphical
    program) and console programs such as bximage and niclist.  Some
    sdl and wx compile flags were making bximage and niclist unusable.(Bryce)
  - add concept of cross-configuring in the configure script.  If you
    use the --target option to generate makefiles to be used on another
    machine, some detection of compilers and libraries is disabled. (Bryce)
  - fix term compile on Cygwin, but it has to be done without -mno-cygwin,
    which means that several win32 features such as networking do not work.
  - add "-Wno-multichar" on beos
  - test for largefile support, and add required CFLAGS (Bryce)
  - add -lm when it's needed, and not when it's not (Bryce)
  - add configure support for 8 processors. Bochs can support up to 15
    with some work on the BIOS.
  - fix nmake makefile generation (Psyon)
  - improved pthread detection function from ac-archive project on SF
  - add installer package for Windows, using Nullsoft (Michael Rich, Bryce)
  - on MacOSX, add startup script that creates a text console and then
    runs Bochs.  Also add make target to create a DMG disk image (Br'fin)
  - do not restart the font server on Unix/X11, if vga.pcf was already
    installed.  On several modern machines, if you restart the font
    server the user has to restart X windows. (Bryce)
  - update most .conf.* files with modern options such as
    --enable-all-optimizations. (Bryce)
  - The MacosX .conf script adds /sw/include and /sw/lib to the compile/link
    path list because it is a common place to put dlcompat.  Dlcompat is
    required when building with plugins. (Bryce)
  - rpms can now be built without root privileges (Bryce)

- command line
  - fixed up our command line options (Volker, Bryce, Christophe)
      Usage: bochs [flags] [bochsrc options]
      -n               no configuration file
      -f configfile    specify configuration file
      -q               quick start (skip configuration interface)
      --help           display this help and exit

- configuration file (bochsrc)
  - There are several new options. See the documentation for more details.
    - config_interface: select text mode menus or wxWindows for configuration
    - display_library: select which display lib to use
    - optromimage: load optional rom images
    - ataN (N=0,1,2,3): up to 4 ATA controllers for hard disks, cdroms
    - ataN-master, ataN-slave, N=0,1,2,3: defines a hard disk or cdrom.
      The "ata*" options replace diskc, diskd, and cdromd, which are
      now deprecated.
    - floppy_bootsig_check: control the 0xaa55 signature check on boot floppies
    - logprefix: lets you change the format of log messages
      (patch by Carl Sopchak, help from Christophe)
    - debugger_log: log all output from bochs debugger
    - user_shortcut: allow you to type key combinations like Ctrl-Alt-Del
    - pit: control the PIT model, including realtime option to try to
      keep in sync with real time.
    - Credits: Christophe added optromimage, everything about ATA,
      floppy_bootsig_check, debugger_log.  Bryce added config_interface
      and display_library.  Volker did the user_shortcut button.
      Greg Alexander wrote the PIT model and added the realtime option.
  - since v1.3 we've been able to use environment variables in pathnames
    in the bochsrc file.  Now, a few variables have default values, set at
    compile time, that are used if the user does not set a value.  If Bochs
    is installed correctly, the defaults will be correct and the user will
    not need to override them.
    - $LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH is the path name where the plugins can be found.
      The default value comes from $(plugdir) in the makefile.  This is only
      important if plugins are enabled. (Bryce)
    - $BXSHARE is the path where the BIOSes and keymaps are installed.
      The default value comes from $(sharedir) in the makefile.  Disk
      images on the Bochs website will begin to use BIOS pathnames like
      $BXSHARE/BIOS-bios-latest.  On win32, the $BXSHARE default is
      set by the NSIS installer and read from the registry.  On MacoSX,
      the $BXSHARE default is set to the path containing bochs.app.
      (Bryce, Volker, Br'fin)
  - new option in the configuration interface to reset all bochsrc
    settings to initial defaults.  A reset occurs just before reading
    a new configuration file, so that leftover parameters from a
    previous configuration do not affect the new configuration.  Also,
    you can request a reset using the configuration interface. (Volker, Bryce)
  - ne2k line can now specify a script to set up the interface (Christophe)
  - on Unix, also search /etc/bochsrc (Bernhard Bablok)
  - you can use #include in the bochsrc to read configuration from other
    files (Volker)

- CPU
  - speed optimizations from Kevin Lawton, yielding around 2x speedup
    - guest2host_tlb : for entries in the paging TLB which point to normal
      physical memory pages, a pointer to the host address of the emulated
      physical memory (from malloc()) page is stored in the TLB entry.  In
      many cases, this pointer can be used in memory accesses to directly
      read/write the guest memory address.  In exceptional cases, the physical
      memory access routines are used.  Turn on with --enable-guest2host-tlb.
    - repeat IO/string : for some variants of repeatable IO and string
      instructions, the segmentation and paging checks are done in batch along
      with the data transfers, constrained within page boundaries and the
      segment limits.  Turn on with --enable-repeat-speedups.
    - icache : The structure holding instruction decode information was
      reduced to 32 bytes.  24 bytes for the actual decode data, and 4 each
      for pointers to the address resolution routine (not always needed) and
      the instruction emulation routine.  With a reasonably small
      per-instruction decode size, an instruction cache (iCache) was created,
      which is simply a hash table.  The main cpu loop looks in the table
      first; if the instruction has already been decoded, execution can begin
      immediately without decoding.  Turn on with --enable-icache.
    - host specific asm : when compiling on an x86 platform, use of
      x86-specific asms can be enabled to accelerate several facets of
      emulating instructions.  For example, the EFLAGS values are much more
      efficient to calculate when the actual x86 instructions are used to
      generate the EFLAGS values.  Turn on with --enable-host-specific-asms.
      (Kevin, with help from Jas Sandys-Lumsdaine)
    - if you want to enable all the speed optimizations that we believe
      to be stable, use --enable-all-optimizations.  The release binaries
      are built with this option.
  - add support for AMD's x86-64 instruction set.  To enable, configure with
    --enable-x86-64.  The AMD x86-64 support is about 90% complete and is
    still experimental.  We've implemented the core x86-64 instruction set and
    the changes to the rest of Bochs necessary to operate in long mode, but
    we've still to implement checking for canonical 64 bit addresses. The code
    has been tested on a limited number of test programs.  It has been able to
    successfully boot a x86-64 Linux kernel and run a 64 bit userland
    application.  It has also successfully run a DOS based 64 bit protected
    mode test application. (Peter Tattam, with merge/bugfix help from Kevin
    Lawton and Bryce Denney)
  - add MMX support. To enable, configure with --enable-mmx.
    (Stanislav Shwartsman)
  - add SSE and SSE2 support. To enable, configure with --enable-sse=1
    or --enable-sse=2. (Stanislav)
  - fixed the behaviour of the bcd instructions AAM, AAD and DAA based on
    SF patch #537146 (Volker)
  - stop printing an error for VERR/VERW. According to the i386 opcode
    description there is no error present. (Volker)
  - fix bug [ 625878 ] reset doesn't reset something(?). Fix cpu reset
    when executing a rep instruction (Christophe)
  - use accessors methods for CFLAGS and several other registers, so that
    the implementation can be changed transparently later (Bryce, Stanislav)
  - add support for page size extensions, also known as 4meg pages.
    Turn on with --enable-4meg-pages. (Kevin Lawton)
  - add support for page global extensions.  Turn on with
    --enable-global-pages.   (Kevin)
  - add support for physical address extensions.  Turn on with --enable-pae.
    (Peter Tattam)
  - implement RDMSR and WRMSR. not all MSRs are supported (Zwane Mwaikambo)

- I/O devices
  - rewrote pc_system timers (Kevin)
  - biosdev
    - this new device handles the panic/error/info/debug messages sent
      by the Bios and VGABios.  It was previously done in the unmapped device.
  - cdrom
    - implementation of the function READ TOC for cdrom image files. (Volker)
    - function capacity() for win32 fixed. Now it returns the number of blocks
      instead of bytes. (Volker)
    - added multiple cdrom support for win32 (NT/2000 version untested). The
      ASPI version uses the cdrom drives in the system's order. Drive letters
      are not used by ASPI. (Volker)
    - fix configure script's cdrom detection on BeOS (Bryce)
    - fix physical CD change at runtime (Bryce)

- configuration interface
  - wxWindows config interface now allows you to change every bochsrc
    option using menus and dialog boxes.  There is also the beginning of
    a wxWindows graphical debugger, but it needs a lot of work before it
    will be useful.
  - renamed control.cc to textconfig.cc.  Now we're calling it a
    text configuration interface, instead of a control panel.

- display libraries
  - Even though we've had them for years, the term "display library" is new in
    release 2.0.  In the gui directory, Bochs has a number of different C++
    files which you can select to display the text and graphics on the
    simulated monitor.  Each of these is a display library.  The display
    libraries are:
      x          use X windows interface, cross platform
      win32      use native win32 libraries
      carbon     use Carbon library (for MacOS X)
      beos       use native BeOS libraries
      macintosh  use MacOS pre-10
      amigaos    use native AmigaOS libraries
      sdl        use SDL library, cross platform
      svga       use SVGALIB library for Linux, allows graphics without X
      term       text only, uses curses/ncurses library, cross platform
      rfb        provides an interface to AT&T's VNC viewer, cross platform
      wx         use wxWindows library, cross platform
      nogui      no display at all
  - it is now possible to compile Bochs with support for many different
    display libraries and select the one to use at runtime (even without
    plugins).  See the display_library directive in .bochsrc.
  - add new svgalib display library by Igor Popik
  - fix bug [ 614724 ] SDL can get stuck in full screen mode
    display libraries such as SDL which have a full screen mode can be
    dangerous, if Bochs does not switch back to normal display mode at
    the right time.  This is fixed for SDL and the new svga.
  - keymap support added in SDL interface (Bryce, Volker)
  - new keymap files: SDL keymaps for US and DE keyboards,  X11 keymap
    for Danish keyboard.
  - use keyboard mapping for keyup messages too
  - renamed almost all references to data type "Boolean" to "bx_bool".
    The Boolean data type was defined in Carbon.h headers, and conflicted
    with Bochs's definition.  See bug [ 618388 ] Unable to boot under MacOS X
    Exceptions: When talking to the Carbon library, you must use Boolean.
    Also, siminterface.h uses standard "bool" instead of bx_bool.
  - "User" button added in toolbar. It can send keyboard shortcuts to
    the guest OS. (Volker)
  - snapshot improvement and memory leak fixed (Volker)
  - testing framework, based on comparing screen content, added (Greg)
  - term display library:
    - support for color terminal, function keys, clear screen (Volker)
    - solaris compilation problem (bug #613393) fixed (Bryce)
  - win32 display library:
    - use native win32 toolbar for headerbar, use system palette (Volker)
  - many Carbon interface improvements:
    - patch [ 549248 ] Fix Carbon key & menu handling (Chris Thomas)
    - partial keymap support, copy&paste, menu items fixed, new toolbar
      behavior, dialog box display for panics (Br'fin)
  - sdl display library:
    - keyboard fixes and key mapping added (Bryce)
    - when captured, the mouse is forced to stay in the window. fix bug
      [ 619283 ] SDL: os mouse pointer leaves the window (Bryce)
  - x display library:
    - bug [ #537593 ] vga font not being found fixed. If vga font not
      found, search for a font called "-*-vga-*" (Bryce)
    - keyboard problems fixed (Bryce, Christophe)
  - beos platform, any display library: add a nice icon to the executable
    (Bernd Korz)

- wxWindows
  - wxWindows is a cross-platform C++ user interface library which you can
    download for free at http://wxwindows.org.  wxWindows provides C++
    classes for all sorts of GUI controls (buttons, menubars, etc.) and
    implements all of them using the native controls on the platform.
  - The new wxWindows port of Bochs provides both a graphical configuration
    interface (for editing bochsrc options) and a display.  It was
    written by Bryce Denney, Don Becker, Dave Poirier, and Volker Ruppert.
  - In release 2.0, we concentrated on making the wxWindows port as stable
    and functional as the other interfaces.  wxWindows provides a great
    toolbox that we can use to make Bochs easier to learn and use.
  - wxWindows supports charmap changes, keyboard mapping, cut and paste,
    text and graphics modes, text mode cursor size, and mouse (Volker, Bryce)
  - To compile Bochs with wxWindows, you should install wxWindows 2.3.3
    or later.  Then configure Bochs with --with-wx.
  - if you have multiple versions of wxWindows installed (e.g. a debug
    and a release version), you can set $WX_CONFIG before configuring
    to select between them. (Bryce)

- Bochs debugger
  - [ 609616 ] remote GDB stub
    add GDB Stub support from Johan Rydberg, with bug fixes by Stu Grossman
  - add hooks for external debugger for win32.  The external debugger
    that connects to Bochs is distributed in
    build/win32/tattam-external-debugger.zip in binary form. Turn on
    with --enable-external-debugger.  (Peter)
  - add "debugger_log" option to bochsrc, which logs all debug output
    into a file. feature [ 629068 ] (Christophe)
  - debugger is now usable in fullscreen SDL and SVGA guis.  It will
    switch back to text mode for each debug prompt (Bryce)
  - disassembly output cleaned up and improved
    (Kernel Panic, Peter Tattam, Jonathan Shapiro, Luiz Henrique Shigunov)
  - fix [ 628806 ] debug: x/c prints unprintable chars (Bryce)
  - add the beginnings of a wxWindows debugger. Not ready for mainstream use
    yet. CPU register display is implemented, and you can type any debugger
    command you want into the Debug Console window. (Bryce)
  - add help command (Alexander Krisak)
  - symbol table lookups cleaned up a bit (Bryce)
  - displays the address of the caught watchpoint, feature #435271 (Dave)
  - remove obsolete "loader"

- utilities
  - fixed bug [ 487758 ] bximage fails on file creation >2048meg
    Bximage should now work up to 32gig. (Bryce)
  - on win32, both bximage and niclist now ask the user to press
    return before exiting, so that you have time to read the results
    before the window disappears. (Bryce)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.4.1 (June 22, 2002):

- now cdrom is enabled in configure, unless you specifically disable
  it with --disable-cdrom. (Christophe)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.4 (March 27, 2002):
- ROM BIOS
  - Boot from CDROM!  Christophe Bothamy added partial El Torito support in
    rombios.c, which allows Bochs to boot cdroms.  Booting from win2k or winXP
    cdrom is not supported yet.  The default BIOS includes El Torito functions.
    the boot line must say "cdrom".
    Example:
      boot: cdrom
  - implementation of int13 diskette function 5 (format track) (Volker)
  - initialisation of PIC and DMA-2 added to POST code (Volker)
- configure script (Bryce Denney)
  - the configure script now detects your platform and provides a default
    GUI and the required compiler flags.  All supported platforms should
    compile with simply "configure" and "make".
  - default guis by platform:
     - win32/windows/cygwin: win32 gui
     - MacOS X: carbon gui
     - MacOS 9 or earlier: macos gui
     - BeOS: beos gui
     - AmigaOS: amigaos gui
     - all other platforms: X windows gui
  - compile arguments supplied by configure script
    - win32: too many to list here; see documentation
    - cygwin: -mno-cygwin -DWIN32
	- MacOS X: -fpascal-strings -fno-common -arch ppc -Wno-four-char-constants
	           -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Dmacintosh
  - the --with-GUINAME configure option is only needed if you want to override
    the default GUI.  This is the only way to use the Term, RFB, and SDL
    GUIs.
- VGA
  - added VESA BIOS Extensions code by Jeroen Janssen (banked mode only, LFB
	support in patches)
  - vga memory read/write functions in text mode fixed
  - implementation of CGA mode 320*200*4 (patch from Sebastien Bechet)
- VGA BIOS
  - updated Christophe Bothamy's LGPL VGA BIOS to version 0.3a.  This consists
    of a bug fix for function ah=13 and VBE support by Jeroen Janssen.
- networking
  - chipmem read/write limit fixed (Mike Lerwill)
  - writing a byte in 16-bit mode now possible (Mike Lerwill)
  - new ethertap interface for Linux, which allows Bochs to talk to
    the local machine and the internet (Bryce Denney)
  - NE2000 is now enabled by default on Win32, Cygwin, and Linux compiles
    in the .conf.* scripts and release binaries.
  - fix check for auto transmit disable, which was checking the wrong bit
    (Peter Tattam)
  - Win32 only
    - niclist.exe has been revised to work on more Windows versions, and it
      suggests a usable ne2k line (Dean Payne)
    - fix timeout setting so that ne2000 does not slow down the whole
      simulation (Don Becker)
    - bug fix: be able to handle multiple packets that arrive at once
      (Mike Lerwill)
- GUI changes
  - cdrom button: click this to notify Bochs when you changed the CDROM (Volker)
  - snapshot button: saves the text on the Bochs screen into a file called
    snapshot.txt (Volker)
  - copy button: on Win32 and X windows, copy the text on the Bochs screen
    to the clipboard (Volker)
  - paste button: on Win32 and X windows, paste the characters on the
    clipboard into the Bochs window.  This requires keyboard_mapping to
    be enabled. (Bryce Denney)
  - improved text mode cursor for Win32, X11, and SDL (Volker)
  - new SDL interface (Dave Poirier, debugging by Christophe, Volker, Bryce)
    SDL is a graphics library that has works on many platforms.  This interface
    is experimental, and is missing a few features of the standard Bochs
    interfaces: extended keys (arrows, keypad).
  - MacOS X: add MacOS X carbonized event handlers by Jeremy Parsons
  - X windows: when not enough colors can be allocated, force use of
    private colormap (Bryce Denney)
  - bug #490570 fixed: OUTB set and command 0xaa encountered (Dave Poirier)
- keyboard
  - completed keyboard emulation with the implementation of the three scancodes
    sets (mf1, mf2, mf3) with or without translation. This is based on Ludovic
    Lange's plex86 keyboard patch. (Christophe Bothamy)
  - added a "keyboard_type" option, that defines the answer to an "identify
    keybord" request to the keyboard controller. The available values are
    "xt","at","mf".  (Christophe Bothamy)
  - added an optional keyboard_mapping option that enables to use your
    country specific keyboard with Bochs.  If enabled, the keymap file must be
    specified in bochsrc.  The available keymaps are US, German, Spanish and
    French for PCs running X11.  Contributions are welcomed.  (Christophe
    Bothamy)
  - added Windows(tm) key definitions (Volker Ruppert)
  - added paste button, which causes the emulated keyboard to type characters
    from the system clipboard.  This only works when keyboard_mapping is
    enabled. (Bryce Denney)
- cdrom
  - bug fix: win32 could not read a cdrom image file
  - eject cd support for linux (patch from Petr Stehlik)
  - BeOS fixes
  - changing cdrom media is possible now with CDROM button
- sound blaster(tm) emulation (Volker)
  - you can use --enable-sb16=freebsd now
  - 16-bit DMA controller added
  - 16-bit mode of the SB16 implemented (output to file works)
- floppy drive (Volker Ruppert)
  - implementation of the floppy command 'format track'
  - implementation of read / write operations with MT=0
  - behaviour of a few floppy commands fixed
  - floppy reset behaviour fixed
  - lots of other fixes
- fixed bug [ #468340 ] pic:slave: OCW3 not implemented.  Now the slave PIC
  supports all the modes that the master PIC does, and nobody will see this
  message again.
- serial port (by Volker Ruppert unless noted)
  - improved IRQ handling
  - now Windows 95 serial driver works correctly
  - fixed the return value of the MCR (loopback bit)
  - interrupt reasons LSR change and MSR change implemented
  - the number of data bits is considered when sending data
  - all serial port changes are tested in loopback mode only
  - serial port emulation fixed for FreeBSD and OpenBSD (Stu Grossman)
  - fix receiver poll frequency so that it doesn't slow emulation (Stu Grossman)
- Bochs debugger
  - when tracing, print the instruction just before it is executed, instead
    of just after (Greg Alexander)
  - after a triple-fault panic, you can now return to the debugger
- symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) simulation
  - no more panic if you read the EOI register
  - fixed default destination format in local APIC
  - fix SMP instruction tracing in bochs debugger
  - fix deadlock when debugger enabled and all processors HLT
  - MSR support added by Zwane Mwaikambo
- simulation of interrupts is more accurate (Volker)
  - implemented edge triggered interrupt mode
  - added functions raise_irq() and lower_irq()
- programmable interrupt timer (Greg Alexander)
  - fixed the PIT gate and improved the PIT printing options
  - experimental real-time PIT
- parallel port improvements (Volker Ruppert)
- bug fix: hard disk errors caused by overflowing imul in the BIOS code.
  Sebastian Bechet and Peter Tattam tracked it down and fixed it.
- fix some memory leaks (patch from Darko Tominac)
- Double-Word IO is supported for ATA devices
- fix bash-specific syntax in install-x11-fonts script
- print stack_return_from_v86 error only the first 100 times

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.3 (December 10, 2001):
- networking works on Windows and Linux platforms
- emulated cdrom can now read from ISO image files, on any platform.
- new PIT model by Greg Alexander which is much more complete than the
  old one.  The new PIT is used by default, but you can switch back to
  the old one if you configure with --disable-new-pit.
  (PIT = 8254 programmable interrupt timer)
- new configuration menus by Bryce Denney, which allow you to change any
  bochsrc option using text menus, then save the configuration into
  a new bochsrc file for later use.  You can disable the new code using
  configure --disable-control-panel.  Also you can use the command
  line arguments -nocp or -nocontrolpanel.  Also, there is a new
  "Config" button on the GUI that allows limited changes to the
  configuration at runtime, such as changing the floppy disk.
- add docbook documentation directory in the sources under doc/docbook.
  The transition from HTML to docbook documentation is still in progress.
- Add new log action "ask", as shown in these example bochsrc lines:
    panic: action=ask
    error: action=ask
  When an event occurs which is set to "ask", you get a beep and message
  on the text terminal that asks what you want to do.  Choices are: continue,
  continue and disable future messages from this device, quit immediately,
  or segfault (where abort() function is available).  If compiled with
  --enable-debugger, you can also choose to enter the debugger.
- Parallel port emulation cleaned up by Volker Ruppert.  See .bochsrc for
  syntax of new parport1 line in bochsrc.
- PCI support improved by Volker Ruppert, including BIOS changes.  Still
  not complete.
- floppy controller returns a proper error response if you try to write
  a read-only disk image.  For systems such as DOS that actually use the BIOS
  services, it was also necessary to add code in int13_diskette_function to
  recognize a write-protected error and return the correct error status code
  (AH=3, Carry Set).
- the ROM BIOS now prints panic messages to the console.  Thanks to Cliff
  Hones for his console display code.
- the ROM BIOS detects nonbootable disks (Barry Allard), and prints a message
  on the console.  Barry Allard's patch who helped with checking the boot
  signature.
- LBA support added for hard disks.  (Not tested very much.)
- add dependencies to makefiles
- logging code moved into a separate file, logio.cc
- new option --enable-slowdown-timer, by Greg Alexander, which kicks in if
  Bochs simulation time starts to run faster than real time.  This helps to
  keep the Bochs clock in sync with the real clock when the CPU is mostly
  idle.
- new option --enable-iodebug, by Dave Poirier, which creates an I/O
  interface to the debugger.  This lets you write software to be emulated
  in Bochs which can turn on instruction, register, or memory tracing
  using I/O accesses.
- improved detection of readline in configure script
- configure substitutes the version number into many files, instead of
  using sed in the makefile.  There are still a few uses of sed remaining.
- you can now use environment variables in bochsrc values.  For example,
  diskd: file="$BOCHS_IMG/diskd.img", cyl=615, heads=6, spt=17
- configure with --prefix=PATH works now
- running configure from a different directory works now, thanks to
  a patch from Edouard G. Parmelan
- fix [ #433759 ] virtual address checks can overflow.
  > Bochs has been crashing in some cases when you try to access data which
  > overlaps the segment limit, when the segment limit is near the 32-bit
  > boundary.  The example that came up a few times is reading/writing 4 bytes
  > starting at 0xffffffff when the segment limit was 0xffffffff.  The
  > condition used to compare offset+length-1 with the limit, but
  > offset+length-1 was overflowing so the comparison went wrong.
- cmpxchg8b patch from Michael Hohmuth <hohmuth@innocent.com>
- apply patch from Thomas Fitzsimmons <fitzsim@cygnus.com> to fix compile
  problems when BX_SUPPORT_PAGING and BX_USE_TLB are turned off
- fix bug introduced in 1.2.1 which caused spurious exceptions.
  See patch #439314, Exception 1 (debug) on HALT, from
  thomas.petazzoni@meridon.com.
- add panic in ctrl_xfer32.cc where the IRET32 implementation is broken.
  This only happens if you are NOT in vm8086 mode or protected mode.
  The intent is to warn people when they are getting bad emulation, and
  encourage people to report how they got to that point.
- apply patch from Santiago Bazerque.  See this bug report:
  [ #463018 ] retf not removing parameters sometimes
- fix bug [ #461730 ] IRETD causes problems if NT-flag is set
  reported by Peter Lammich.
- apply patch [ #455014 ] CR0 bug in 80486, described as:
  > In the register CR0, when the bit PM is enabled, the bit 4 is 0
  > when should be 1.
- apply patch from Mike Rieker <mrieker@o3one.org> associated with this bug
  report: [ #480422 ] gdt 'accessed' bit
- in task_switch when it tried to ensure that the old TSS was paged in,
  it actually used the new TSS address, fixed.
- updated the instrumentation code, and added a working example.  To try
  it, configure --enable-instrumentation=instrument/example1.  Then when
  you run bochs, you will get one line for each instruction PC and for
  each I/O access in a new file called bxevent.txt.
- set a bit in the CMOS that says the processor has an FPU.  This is
  from patch [ #455006 ] Device byte is not initialized aptly.
  Author did not leave their name.
- add logging code to the "null ethernet" which does not require host OS
  support.  All this does is print the outgoing packets from the guest OS.
- cleanup of log functions (Todd Fries)
- add BX_ERROR for every command in ATAPI-6 that bochs does not support.
  I still need to do add some commands from older specs that are obsolete
  (and not listed) in ATAPI-6.  Commands that aren't in the spec will still
  panic.
- only put 0xf into the 2nd hard disk field when the cdrom is not present.
  This is a patch from Volker Ruppert <Volker.Ruppert@t-online.de>, who
  comments: "The fdisk command reports an unusable second harddisk if the cdrom
  is enabled. This patch helps, but I don't know if it is the right way."
- make hard disk code return error codes when data is not available instead
  of just panicing.  In particular, if the logical sector is out of bounds
  or the disk image cannot be read/written at the desired offset, we now
  abort the ATA command and return an error code.  Many of the old BX_PANIC
  messages are turned to BX_ERROR, so they will still appear in the
  log, but now the device model will try to communicate this fact to
  the OS instead of simply giving up.
- don't blindly reject odd length atapi commands.  There are cases when
  it's really ok according to ATA-4.
- for big endian machines, reversed the bit fields in interrupt_reason.
  This was pointed out by Nicholai Benalal.
- extended keyboard improvements by Dave Poirier
- major mouse patch from Dave Spring, that implements several missing
  mouse modes.
- commit keyboard patch from David Haslam <dch@sirius.clara.co.uk>
  posted to mailing list, that addresses the problem of each key press
  printing ^@.  See cvs log for details.
- mouse performance fixes by Greg Alexander and Robb Main
- NE2000 fixes by Frode Vatvedt Fjeld, ecelca@yahoo.com, Greg Alexander,
  and angelos@openbsd.org.
- fix bug [ #468340 ] pic:slave: OCW3 not implemented.  Some event handling
  code appeared in the master pic but not the slave pic.
- fix compile problems in SB16 code, related to fpos_t being treated as
  an integer.
- patch from Volker Ruppert <Volker.Ruppert@t-online.de> to fix
  midi output file so that winamp can play it.
- some cleanup of serial code by Todd Fries and Volker Ruppert, but it
  doesn't work yet.

X Windows specific:
- commit patch from David Haslam <dch@sirius.clara.co.uk>
  [ #455763 ] Cursor trail with DOS Edit/Minix vi
- error for missing fonts now points to the documentation
- new option --enable-idle-hack, by Roland Mainz, which makes Bochs more
  friendly toward other processes when its CPU is idle.  Presently,
  this option is specific to X windows.

Win32 specific:
- now Windows 95/98/ME can read the physical cdrom (Don Becker)
- The default configuration for Win32 VC++, given in .conf.win32-vcpp,
  now enables the NE2000 and renames all .cc files to .cpp.  This keeps VC++
  happy but may make it hard to use CVS.
- The default configuration for Cygwin, given in .conf.win32-cygwin, now
  enables cdrom and SB16.
- See "new docs" on the web site for compile instructions for VC++ and Cygwin.
- The sources include a VC++ workspace, in addition to the old "nmake"
  makefile.
- ethernet support (emulated NE2000 card), coded by Don Becker.  This
  implementation requires a library called WinPCap, which you can
  download from http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap.
- new utility called niclist.exe which lists the ID number of all your network
  cards (well probably you just have one).  The ID be used when setting up your
  .bochsrc.
- patch [ #466403 ] make text colors more accurate.  The author did not leave
  his/her name.
- fix GUI bug [ #452159 ] win32: mouse stuck if bochs win partly off screen
  Now we center the mouse periodically, whether or not the mouse has
  wandered outside of the window or not.
- event handler recognizes the extended keycode flag
- fixes for raw floppy and floppy disk images (Don Becker)

Linux specific:
- Ethernet (emulated NE2000 card) now works in Linux!  Contributed by
  splite@purdue.edu.  This has been tested using host OS kernel 2.2.14, and
  works with telnet, ftp, irc, lynx, etc.  Because it is a packet filter
  solution, you aren't able to talk to the host machine, only to other
  machines on the network.
- The default configuration for Linux, given in .conf.linux, now enables
  the NE2000 model.
- RPM build process configures with --prefix=/usr so that everything is
  installed in /usr/bochs instead of /usr/local/bochs.
- DLX Linux disk image is now installed so that only root can write it, to
  avoid security problems.  When you run the bochs-dlx script, it creates a
  local copy in your home directory and then runs it.
- code that determines the capacity of a cdrom now works for both ATAPI
  and SCSI drives (splite@purdue.edu)
- applied patch from bochs@sigint.cs.purdue.edu.  The comments are:
  > The Linux 2.4.5 CD-ROM driver sends a READ_DISC_INFO command which caused
  > an "unrecognized ATAPI command" panic.  Looks like READ_DISC_INFO is only
  > recognized by CD-R and CD-RW drives, so I ignore it for now.

Amiga MorphOS specific:
- Bochs now compiles and works on Amiga MorphOS.  Configure with
  --with-amigaos.  For AmigaOS only, see .bochsrc for use of fullscreeen and
  screenmode options.  The Amiga MorphsOS is written and maintained by
  Nicholai Benalal <nicholai@chello.se>.
- raw cdrom supported if you configure with --enable-cdrom

BeOS specific:
- Bochs compiles and works on BeOS.  Configure with --with-beos.
  Bernd Thorsten Korz <bernd.korz@insidebeos.de> maintains the BeOS port.
- raw cdrom supported if you configure with --enable-cdrom

MacOS X specific:
- Bochs now compiles and works on MacOS X.  Configure with --with-carbon.
  Emmanuel Mailliard <e.rsz@libertysurf.fr> ported the Macintosh code to the
  Carbon API.
- The MacOS X application is built using (gasp) mkdir, copy, and rez.
  Surely this is not the right way, but it works.
- raw cdrom supported if you configure with --enable-cdrom

RFB mode:
- apply patch.rfb-mouse by MURANAKA Masaki (monaka@users.sf.net)
  see this source forge bug [ #457968 ] Strange mouse motion on RFB
- add a retry loop in RFB code, so that if port 5900 is not available
  it can try 5901, etc.

Bochs Debugger:
- do a vga update whenever you print a debugger prompt.
- added debugger command "info fpu" that prints the FPU registers.  If you
  do "info all" you get cpu and fpu registers.
- added debugger command "info ne2k" which prints all the registers
  of the NE2000 model
- add ability to do register tracing and flag tracing (Dave Poirier).
  Try the trace-reg-on and trace-reg-off commands.
- instruction trace now includes time ticks
- fixed problems in which bochs compiled with debugger measured time
  differently from bochs compiled without debugger.  Also when instruction
  trace was enabled, breakpoints and control-C did not work.  Also,
  breakpoints at the beginning of an interrupt handler did not work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.2.1 (June 12, 2001):
- more work on makefile for building RPMs
- [ #432382 ] build debian packages patch
  add build/debian directory from Rob Lemley <rjlemley@calypsoblue.org>
  which allows us to make Debian packages!
- optimize for speed when simulating one processor.  Now 1-processor
  performance should be equivalent to 1.1.2.
- [ #425640 ] sb16 assumes fpos_t is long int
  This fixes compiles of iodev/sb16.cc on linux systems with newer libraries
  in which fpos_t is not an integer.
- [ #432488 ] SMP:assert "n_logfn < MAX_LOGFNS" fails
  increase MAX_LOGFNS since we ran out of them on an SMP simulation with
  4 processors
- changes to compile clean on cygwin:
  - don't use the WIN32 snprintf define for cygwin
  - add ssize_t definition for cygwin
  - only compile "struct timeval tval" if select is available
    on that platform.
- [ #432491 ] SMP: CPUID says no APIC feature
  clean up inconsistent use of BX_SUPPORT_APIC and BX_APIC_SUPPORT, which
  caused the CPUID to report no APIC was present
- [ #431025 ] --enable-external-device-models broken
  removed configure options for external-device-models and
  external-cpu-memory.  These don't work and aren't going to be fixed.
- [ #429448 ] configure: -lreadline when not there
  Now configure allows you to choose not to use readline, even if it's found
  on your system.
- [ #428915 ] apply extended keyboard patch
  extended keyboard patch by Dave Poirier <eks@void-core.2y.net>
- [ #428626 ] if no X11 found, configure&make fails
  Now configure halts if X windows is selected but no X libraries are found.
- updated rombios to version 1.13.  This fixes several problems:
  - [ #430472 ] DOS HIMEM "A20 line" error
    This problem was apparantly caused when Bryce added a function that prints
    the BIOS version, and he called it too early in the boot process.  Now the
    same function is called later, and it doesn't break the A20.
  - [ #431010 ] SMP structure overwritten in v1.2
    SMP structures were getting overwritten by BCC-generated data,
    preventing SMP operating systems from detecting that other processors
    were available.
  - [ #431016 ] bios: SMP struct has wrong entry count
    SMP structure had the wrong entry counts
- very minor doc updates (typos, replace broken link to mtools info)
- quit when the user clicks the power button, even if they have disabled
  panics.
- win32 now defaults to having mouse capture mode turned off.  For new users,
  it would be distressing for their mouse cursor to disappear until they
  pressed F12.
- [ #428222 ] vga font not installed
  added script called "install-x11-fonts" which should help people install
  the VGA font on X windows systems, if it isn't already there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in 1.2 (June 3, 2001):
- [ #427259 ] rombios HALT calls don't print
  Fixed bios/rombios.c HALT macro so that it writes the line number of the
  panic to the PANIC_PORT (port 0x400) and then does NOT do a halt
  instruction.  Also changed iodev/unmapped.cc so that the line number written
  to PANIC_PORT is displayed as a BX_PANIC message.  Because the HALT
  macro now triggers the normal panic behavior, it can be controlled by
  the bochsrc.
- [ #429016 ] crash if no hard drive
  rombios used to call HALT macro if no hard drive was found. Now it only
  calls HALT if a hard drive has an illegal geometry.
- [ #425388 ] include source for simple disk img tool
  [ #428478 ] mkimg tool creates image 1 byte too big
  Added bximage tool, which makes empty floppy and hard disk images.
  It is now included in the top level Makefile, so it will get built
  by default on all platforms.
- [ #426036 ] eth_fbsd.cc compile problem on solaris26
  added configure test so that "configure --enable-ne2000" only
  includes the Berkeley Packet Filter code (eth_fbsd) if the header
  file <net/bpf.h> can be found.  If you don't have BPF the ne2000
  will not actually move packets, but at least it will compile clean now.
- [ #428214 ] 1.2.pre1 need documentation for binaries
  Write windows and linux specific documentation to be installed in
  binary releases.
- [ #429258 ] disable RESET for version 1.2
  Since soft reset was not completely working, I reverted the reset patch.
  Now it does panics on reset instead of trying to reboot, as the old
  bochs versions did.
- [ #428222 ] Should the linux RPM install vga font?
  now font/vga.pcf will be installed in the RPM package
- [ #429020 ] stop renaming the BIOS!!!
  new BIOS changes are now in BIOS-bochs-latest, instead of a BIOS
  whose name changes every time we change anything!  To help distinguish
  different BIOS versions, the BIOS now prints its RCS Id into the
  log file.
- [ #428625 ] compile problem if SHOW_IPS is on
  removed extra paren that broke SHOW_IPS
- [ #428219 ] PCI doesn't compile with SMF=1
- [ #429375 ] pthreads detection broken
- [ #429073 ] configure: if no X11, makes bad config
- [ #429229 ] install current .bochsrc in binary rels
- install Tim's man pages on linux RPM
- BIOS prints messages in log in case of boot failure
- rewrote instructions for compiling in win32 (win32.txt)
- fixed link in HTML changelog.html to point to the real sources on SF.
- added missing LOG_THIS definition to gui/nogui.cc and gui/rfb.cc
- added additional check for null pointer in debugger exit routine
- added diskd to .bochsrc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.2-pre1 (May 25, 2001):
- major cleanup of .bochsrc
- major cleanup of stderr output: prints bochs version information when
  starting, and at the end it tries to print the message that caused
  bochs to quit.
- two hard disk support (diskd).  At present, you cannot have two
  hard drives and a cdrom at the same time, because there is only
  one IDE controller with two channels.
- split hard disk support allows different partitions to be stored in
  different image files
- two new GUI choices: term mode and RFB mode.  Term is a text-only
  interface, and RFB creates a server that can be accessed using
  the AT&T VNC viewer.
- now Bochs can simulate an SMP machine, if you configure with
  --enable-processors=N.  Configuring more than one processor has
  a major performance impact, so the default is 1 processor.
  See SMP documentation for more details.
- to make SMP work, bx_mem and bx_cpu have been replaced with
  bx_mem_array[] and bx_cpu_array[].  The cpus are referenced through
  the BX_CPU(n) macro and memories through the BX_MEM(n).  Normal
  mode has one cpu and one memory, SMP mode has multiple cpu's and
  one memory, cosimulation mode has multiple cpus and multiple memories.
- use --enable-cpu-level=6 to make Bochs claim to be a Pentium Pro.
  The only feature that requires CPU level 6 is apic support.
- new logging system by Todd Fries, which has 4 levels of event
  severity (panic, error, info, debug).  There are new .bochsrc
  options that control what action to take when a
  panic/error/info/debug event occurs.
- now searches for .bochsrc, bochsrc, bochsrc.txt, and (on unix only)
  $HOME/.bochsrc.
- use GNU readline library if --enable-debugger is on, as long as readline
  can be found on the machine
- configure checks for existence strtoull and strtouq. if neither exists,
  Bochs uses its own implementation
- applied patches from Cliff Hones <cliff@aonix.co.uk> to fix up the
  rombios.  This includes many improvements, which you can list by
  doing "cvs log -r 1.6 bios/rombios.c" or looking at cvsweb.
- added suggested geometries of larger disks to the documentation
- this is the first release to have official binary packages for win32
  and Linux.  There is a new "make rpm" in the top-level Makefile which
  will create an RPM of the current bochs directory.  To use this,
  become root and type "configure; make rpm".
- applied some FreeBSD patches from Maxim Sobolev (cdrom and serial).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.2 (bugfix3, May 16, 2001):
- updated Elpin VGA BIOS to version 2.40, and changed pointer in .bochsrc
- fixed .conf.x86 script so that it uses c++ instead of egcs for C++ files
- now Makefile targets that recurse into subdirectories use double colons,
  so that it will always recurse into subdirectories.  Now a single make
  command should notice a modified source file in a subdir.
- fixed bug in bx_panic.  If BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL==0 and a (non-fatal) panic
  occurs, it used to call bx_atexit() and then return.  It should never
  call bx_atexit, which starts to shut down the simulator, unless it's
  really going to quit!
- support 2.88 MB floppy disks
- since dataseghack is checked in as non-executable, invoke it with
  "csh dataseghack"
- double fault patch from Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@ifrance.com>,
  sourceforge patch #423726.
- removed -fno-builtin from fpu makefiles
- redefine u_char, u_short, etc. in order to not conflict with system
  definitions of these same types.
- in cdrom.cc, remove the extern "C" { } structure around some of the
  header files.  This is no longer necessary.
- do not panic on hard disk command 0x1f2 (read sector count)
- in keyboard.cc:
  - apply Todd Fries' reset patch
  - recognize most of the "Grey" insert/delete/home/end/etc. keys the
    same as keypad keys.
  - removed panic on "kbd_ctrl_to_kbd(): got value of 0x??"
  - implement mouse command 0xf6 (set defaults)
- apply Suboner@aol.com's Xwindows timing patch from
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=418730&group_id=12580&atid=312580
- remove all patches from patches subdir which have already been applied.
  The remaining ones are under consideration but not applied.

Changes in version 1.1.1 (bugfix2, April 9, 2001):
- in soundwin.cc, arg 3 should be typecast to LPWAVEFORMATEX
- in fpu_entry.c, Bryce mistyped his own initials!

   #define BX_64BIT_CONSTANTS_USE_LL 0
   #define inline __inline
   #define BX_NO_EMPTY_STRUCTS 1
   #define BX_NO_ATTRIBUTES 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1 (bugfix1, April 6, 2001):

(FIXED, patch #414360: update copyrights)
update headers.  Change copyright to 2001, replace config.h.in header with
the standard mandrake header that every other file uses.

(FIXED, patch #414356: inlines)
make macro to replace inline and static/extern keywords.  Then make
define the macro appropriately based on configure.

(FIXED: patch #414234: macos-no-strdup)
--with-macos should force HAVE_STRDUP=0.

(FIXED, patch #403027: Fix mouse bugs in Linux and BSD)
Linux and BSD (maybe others) cause panic in mouse code.

(FIXED, patch #413851: const64bit patch)
VC++ does not allow "LL" after 64-bit constant.

(FIXED, patch #413859: fabs symbol conflict)
fpu code contains fabs, which conflicts with math library fabs.

(FIXED, patch #403004: Implement aborts on a few SET FEATURE commands...)
Implement aborts on a few SET FEATURE commands for ATA.

(FIXED, patch #402991: Update to iodev/vga.cc to add 3c3h read support)
Implement VGA enable register, at 0x3c3.

(FIXED, patch #403027: Fix mouse bugs in Linux and BSD)
Mouse panic in linux/BSD:
KBD: io write 0x64: command = 0xD3(write mouse outb)

(FIXED, patch #414229: panic-is-fatal)
Allow user to decide if panic is fatal, or just a warning

(FIXED, patch #414230: sun-cdrom)
Support Sun CDROM

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
there are cases where a pointer is cast to a 32-bit int,
then later cast to a pointer and dereferenced, which crashes any 64-bit
machine.

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
some machines have no snprintf or strtoull.  include a replacement function
when needed.

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
Some compilers don't allow "typedef struct { } foo;"

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
Some people don't have hash_map.h, used in dbg_main.cc.  Disable this code
if hash_map.h not found.

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
Some compilers can't handle labels at the end of a block, as in
   void main () { /*code*/ label: }

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
Most compilers can't handle __attribute__.  Use macro to define it away.

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
if --enable-debugger, turn on --enable-disasm too.

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
ome compilers can't handle any chars after an #endif

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
wrong type arg1 of bx_dbg_watch and bx_dbg_unwatch.  The code in
lexer.l was calling it with integers (not booleans)

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
in fpu code, "setcc" macro was implemented with braces inside parens,
which some compilers don't understand.

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
in fpu_entry.c, FPU_load_int32 was consistently called with arg1 of
type (s32 *), but should be (u32 *)

(FIXED, patch #413574: portable1)
comment out sigcontext structure in fpu/stubs/asm/sigcontext.h because
it conflicted with sigcontext of other machines.  This struct was never
used by bochs anyway.

(FIXED, patch #414046: portable2)
move definition of missing library functions into osdep.h and osdep.cc,
include contents of macutils*.

(FIXED, patch #414061: win32-rawcd)
CDROM drive letter for WIN32 should not be hardcoded.

(FIXED, patch #414060: win32-rawfloppy)
Bypass fstat when opening WIN32 raw floppy disk.

(FIXED, patch #414226: pit-panic)
WinME install dies with panic:
bochs: panic, pit: outp(43h): comm Bh, mode 00, bcd 00 unhandled
I think I had a similar problem.  All three timers should support modes
0, 2, and 3.  Other modes really aren't implemented.
