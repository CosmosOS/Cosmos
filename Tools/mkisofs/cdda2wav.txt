  (-D) dev=device		set the cdrom or scsi device (as Bus,Id,Lun).
  (-A) auxdevice=device		set the aux device (typically /dev/cdrom).

        (generic_scsi or cooked_ioctl).
  (-c) channels=channels	set 1 for mono, 2 or s for stereo (s: channels swapped).
  (-s) -stereo			select stereo recording.

  (-b) bits=bits		set bits per sample per channel (8, 12 or 16 bits).
  (-r) rate=rate		set rate in samples per second. -R gives all rates
  (-a) divider=divider		set rate to 44100Hz / divider. -R gives all rates
  (-R) -dump-rates		dump a table with all available sample rates
  (-S) speed=speedfactor	set the cdrom drive to a given speed during reading
  (-P) set-overlap=sectors	set amount of overlap sampling (default is 0)
  (-n) sectors-per-request=secs	read 'sectors' sectors per request.
  (-l) buffers-in-ring=buffers	use a ring buffer with 'buffers' elements.
  (-t) track=track[+end track]	select start track (option. end track).
  (-i) index=index		select start index.
  (-o) offset=offset		start at 'offset' sectors behind start track/index.
        one sector equivalents 1/75 second.
  (-O) output-format=audiotype	set to wav, au (sun), cdr (raw), aiff or aifc format.
  (-C) cdrom-endianess=endian	set little, big or guess input sample endianess.
  (-E) output-endianess=endian	set little or big output sample endianess.
  (-d) duration=seconds		set recording time in seconds or 0 for whole track.
  (-w) -wait			wait for audio signal, then start recording.
  (-F) -find-extremes		find extrem amplitudes in samples.
  (-G) -find-mono		find if input samples are mono.
  (-T) -deemphasize		undo pre-emphasis in input samples.
  (-e) -echo			echo audio data to sound device (see -K) SOUND_DEV.
  (-v) verbose-level=optlist	controls verbosity (for a list use -vhelp).
  (-N) -no-write		do not create audio sample files.
  (-J) -info-only		give disc information only.
  (-L) cddb=cddbpmode		do cddbp title lookups.
        resolve multiple entries according to cddbpmode: 0=interactive, 1=first entry
  (-H) -no-infofile		no info file generation.
  (-g) -gui			generate special output suitable for gui frontends.
  (-Q) -silent-scsi		do not print status of erreneous scsi-commands.
       -scanbus			scan the SCSI bus and exit
  (-M) md5=count		calculate MD-5 checksum for blocks of 'count' bytes.
  (-q) -quiet			quiet operation, no screen output.
  (-p) playback-realtime=perc	play (echo) audio pitched at perc percent (50%-200%).
  (-V) -verbose-scsi		each option increases verbosity for SCSI commands.
  (-h) -help			show this help screen.
  (-B) -alltracks, -bulk	record each track into a seperate file.
       -paranoia		use the lib paranoia for reading.
       -paraopts=opts		set options for lib paranoia (see -paraopts=help).
       -cddbp-server=servername	set the cddbp server to use for title lookups.
       -cddbp-port=portnumber	set the cddbp port to use for title lookups.
       -version			print version information.

Please note: some short options will be phased out soon (disappear)!
