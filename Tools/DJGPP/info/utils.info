bin2h
*****

`bin2h' allows a developer to embed a binary file into a source file,
by converting the binary data to an array of integer values.

Usage: `bin2h' `datafile' SYMBOL `headerfile'

The resulting header file has a format like this:

     unsigned char symbol[] = {
       ... data ...
     };

djecho
******

This program simply echos whatever is given to it on the command line.

Usage: `djecho' [`-n'] [`-o' FILE] stuff . . .

`-n'
     Do not emit the trailing newline after printing the text.

`-o FILE'
     Send output to a FILE.

The purpose of this program is to be able to interact directly with
`make''s ability to pass long command lines to programs.  If you use
redirection, you aren't always able to handle long command lines
(especially since echo is normally in `command.com').  With `djecho',
you can, and you can use the `-o' option to redirect output to a file
(and use the file later as a response file) without using dos's
redirection.

djtar
*****

Usage: `djtar' [`-n' `changeFile'] [`-o' `dir'] [`-t'|`-x'] [`-i']
[`-v'] [`-p'] [`-.'|`-!.'] [`-d'|`-u'|`-b'] `tarfile'

`djtar' is a program that is designed to ease the problems related to
extracting Unix tar files on a DOS machine.  The long file names and
illegal characters make regular tar programs useless.  What `djtar'
does is make some obvious name conversions automatically and give you an
opportunity to provide alternate names for more difficult cases, where
several filenames map to the same name in the restricted 8+3 DOS
filename space.

`djtar' can read compressed tar files and decompress them on the fly.
(This can be also achieved by piping the output of `gzip' to `djtar',
but for very large archives you can run out of free disk space, because
DOS implements pipes as temporary disk files.)  `djtar' knows about all
the compression methods supported by `gzip', namely, deflation (by
`gzip'), LZW compression (by `compress'), LZH compression (as with
`compress -H' available with some versions of `compress'), or Huffman
compression (by `pack').

`djtar' can also decompress files compressed with `zip' or `pkzip', but
only if the `.zip' file contains only files compressed with either the
`deflation' or `stored' (i.e., uncompressed, like with `pkzip -e0')
methods.

`djtar' can also read tar archives (compressed or otherwise) written on
a Unix machine to a diskette as a raw device (i.e., without DOS
filesystem).  To use `djtar' with such archives, specify a name of the
drive (like `A:') as a tarfile argument.

When extracting files from compressed archives, `djtar' will validate
them with whatever reduntant checks are available with the compression
format, and print diagnostic messages whenever these checks fail.  The
checks and the diagnostics are generally identical to those performed
by `gzip'.  Some of the diagnostics are only printed under the verbose
operation switched on by the `-v' switch.  Unless you use the `-i'
switch, `djtar' will refuse to create files and directories beyond the
first tar directory entry which fails the checksum test; this usually
means the file is either corrupted or not in a valid tar format.

An additional bonus of using `djtar' is that it can convert Unix-style
text files to DOS-style text files, and vice versa.  By default, it
will write all files exactly as found in the archive, but the `-u' and
`-d' options can change that.

`djtar' performs a number of file name conversions in an attempt to
make the files fit into MS-DOS's restricted file names.  Any file
ending in `.info-N', where N is a number, becomes `.iN'.  Any file
ending in `.tar.gz' becomes `.tgz'.  Any `++' string within a file name
becomes `xx'.  Any leading dots are changed to underscores (but current
and parent directories, `./' and `../' are left alone).  Any remaining
multiple dots are changed to dashes, unless the part before the dot is
shorter than 3 characters and there are more than 1 dot in the filename,
in which case the dot also becomes an underscore.  As a result, e.g.,
`.foo.a.b' becomes `_foo.a-b', and `sh.lex.c' becomes `sh_lex.c'.

While `djtar' is running, if it cannot successfully perform an
exclusive open of the given file (it will refuse to overwrite an
existing file), it will prompt you for a new name.  You may type in
either a complete path, a replacement file name (no directory part), or
just hit return (the file is skipped).

If `djtar' is called as `djtart', it behaves as if it were called with
the `-t' switch; when called as `djtarx', it behaves like `djtar -x'.
Thus you can create 2 links to `djtar.exe' which will save you some
typing.

By default, `djtar' just lists the contents of the archive(s) given as
its arguments.  If you want to extract files, you must use the `-x'
option.

*Options:*

`-x'
     By default, `djtar' just lists the contents of the archive(s)
     given as its arguments.  If you want to extract files, you must use
     this option, or call `djtar' via a link named `djtarx'.

`-t'
     This option causes `djtar' to only print the contents of the tar
     file, without actually creating any files.  All the decompression,
     CRC checks etc. are still performed; thus, this option can also be
     used to test archive integrity.  This is the default behavior of
     `djtar', unless you call it via a link named `djtarx'.

`-v'
     This option modifies the output format slightly to aid in
     debugging tar file problems.  It also causes `djtar' to emit more
     verbose warning messages and print the compression method for
     compressed archives.

`-.'
     Enable the automatic conversion of dots to underscores and dashes.
     This is the default.

`-!.'
     Disable the conversion of dots.  You get the control of file
     renaming when names of several files clash.

`-n `changeFile''
     This option allows you to specify a list of filename conversions
     ahead of time.  Thus, you can use `djtart' or `djtar -t' to list
     the files, figure out the new names with your favorite editor, and
     supply that file to `djtar'.  This way, you have the fullest
     possible control on how the extracted files will be named on your
     system.

     The format of the `changeFile' file is like this:

          dir/dir/dir/old.name.here  dir/dir/dir/newname.hre
          dir/dir/dir/old2.name.here  dir/dir/dir/newname2.hre

     The directories must be complete, not relative.  The "old"
     directories must match the complete path in the tar file, and the
     "new" directories indicate where the file goes on the DOS disk.

`-d'
     Convert all text files to DOS text format on output.  This won't
     usually affect binary files, but as `djtar' detects the file type
     by looking at its first 512 bytes, a small possibility of a binary
     file rendered useless by this conversion still exists, so you're
     advised to only use this option with archives of text files.

     By default, `djtar' writes all files exactly as it finds them.

`-u'
     Convert all text files to UNIX text format on output.  This won't
     usually affect binary files, but as `djtar' detects the file type
     by looking at its first 512 bytes, a small possibility of a binary
     file rendered useless by this conversion still exists, so you're
     advised to only use this option with archives of text files.

     By default, `djtar' writes all files exactly as it finds them.

`-b'
     Write all files exactly as found in the archive, with no
     conversions of text files.  This is the default.  Files written to
     the console (when `-p' is in effect) are always written in text
     mode, so this option doesn't have any effect when used with `-p',
     unless the output of `djtar' is redirected to a file or a pipe.

`-o STRING'
     Only extract files whose full path names begin with STRING.  This
     option can be used to extract portions of archive.  Files which
     aren't extracted will still be shown, but with a string `[ skipped
     ]' appended to their names.  When given the `-o' option, `djtar'
     actually checks if STRING is the initial substring of each
     filename, so you can specify incomplete file names, thus using
     `-o' as a poor man's wildcard facility.

`-i'
     Attempt to unpack damaged archives.  By default, `djtar' will
     refuse to create files whose directory entries in the tar archive
     fail the checksum test, and any files beyond that point.  This
     option tells `djtar' to ignore the checksum test and proceed
     anyway.  Checksum failure usually means that the tar file is
     either corrupted or not in valid tar format, so this option is
     meant to be used either with the `-t' option, or in the rare cases
     when you *know* for sure the tar file is valid (like if you had to
     edit it to change the filenames).

`-p'
     When given this switch, `djtar' will write the files to its
     standard output, which can be piped into another program (like a
     pager) or redirected to a file.  This option is designed to allow
     you to view or extract individual files (e.g., the `README' files)
     without having to open the entire archive, and should be used with
     an appropriate `-o filename' option.

     When this option is used, diagnostic messages will be directed to
     the standard error stream (as opposed to standard output in normal
     operation), so that they won't get mixed with the files' data.

File: utils.info,  Node: gxx,  Next: redir,  Prev: utod,  Up: Top

gxx
***

This program is exactly like `gcc' (in fact, it calls gcc), except that
it provides the extra libraries required to link most C++ programs,
including the iostreams, stdc, and libg++ libraries.

redir
*****

DOS, in its many flavors and versions, lacks a decent I/O redirection
mechanism.  Sure, it's got < and > and >>, but what about error
messages?  Lots of people ask, "How do you send those error messages to
a file?"  Well, you use a program like `redir'.

`redir' is basically a program that manipulates the standard file
descriptors by copying them, closing and opening them, etc.  Once it
has the file descriptors where it wants them, it runs your program,
which inherits the changed descriptors.  Thus, `redir' has nearly
complete control over the input and output of your program.

It also allows you to view the exit code of the program, and the
elapsed time of the program, by supplying the appropriate options on
the command line.

Note that `redir' is built with command-line expansion and response
files disabled, so as to allow the application to control that
themselves.  This means that you can't use those features to provide
`redir''s options or the command name, but if you use them for the
command's options, the command will do the expansion if it wants to.

The exit code of `redir' is 1 if it exits on its own accord, else it
returns the same error code as the program it runs.

Usage: `redir' [`-i' FILE] [`-o' FILE] [`-oa' FILE] [`-e' FILE] [`-ea'
FILE] [`-eo'] [`-oe'] [`-x'] [`-t'] COMMAND [ARGS . . .]

`-i FILE'
     Redirect stdandard input from file

`-o FILE'
     Redirect standard output to file

`-oa FILE'
     Append standard output to file

`-e FILE'
     Redirect standard error to file

`-ea FILE'
     Append standard error to file

`-eo'
     Redirect standard error to standard output

`-oe'
     Redirect standard output to standard error

`-x'
     Print the exit code of the command after it exits.  If the exit
     code is 0..255, it is printed as is.  If it is not, the low byte
     (0..255) is printed in decimal and the whole value is also printed
     in hex.

`-t'
     Print elapsed time, either in seconds (for short runs) or
     hours:minutes:seconds.

Options are processed in the order they are encountered.  Thus, "-o foo
-eo" means "redirect output to foo, then redirect errors there also",
whereas "-eo -o foo" means "send errors to where output was going, then
move output to foo".

Examples:

To redirect errors to a file:

     redir -e errors.lst command ...

To redirect output to a file, and errors through a pipe:

     redir -eo -o prog.out command ... | pipe

djsplit
*******

The `djsplit' and `djmerge' programs are designed to assist in
transporting files across unreliable channels or small media (like
floppies).  `djsplit' takes a big file and splits it into up to 1000
smaller files.  `djmerge' puts them back together again.

Usage: `djsplit' INPUTFILE CHUNKSIZE OUTPUTBASE

Each output file is made from appending a sequence number to
OUTPUTBASE.  For example:

     djsplit foo.tgz 1300k footgz

would result in `footgz.000', `footgz.001', etc.

The `chunksize' parameter can be expressed as bytes (NNN),
kilobytes(NNNk) or megabytes (NNNm).  The number NNN *must* be an
integer; for example, `1.1m' will *not* work.

Usage: `djmerge' INPUTBASE OUTPUTFILE

Each input file is made from appending a sequence number to INPUTBASE.
For example, given `footgz.000', `footgz.001', etc,

     djmerge footgz foo.tgz

would result in `foo.tgz' being created.

texi2ps
*******

`texi2ps' is a modified version of `makeinfo' that quickly turns
texinfo files (such as info files are generated from) into crude
Postscript files, ready for printing.  The program is designed to
produce a crude page, so please don't complain if the printed copy looks
ugly.  If you want clean pages, get and install TeX and print it with
that.  It will produce a much cleaner print.  I'm also pretty sure that
texi2ps won't support 100% of the texinfo documents out there.  Again,
if you want it right use TeX.

Note that the input files are texinfo files, not TeX or LaTeX or info
files.  In normal djgpp distributions, the texinfo files are part of
the source distributions, and the info files are in the binary
distributions.

The default settings produce a pretty densely packed page - small font,
small margins.  You can set the margins and font even smaller to save on
paper, or make them bigger for more conventional manuals.

Usage: `texi2ps' [`-f' SIZE] [`-I' DIR] [`-I'DIR] [`-v'] [`-m' PTS] FILE

`-f SIZE'
     The font size, in points.  The default is 10 points.

`-I PATH'
     Specifies an additional path to search for include files.

`-v'
     Print verbose messages about files read, nodes encountered, and
     pages generated.

`-m PTS'
     Set the margin size in points.  The default is 54 points, or 3/4
     inches (72 points = 1 inch).

Note that the Postscript file is sent to standard output, so you must
redirect the output to a file or a printer.


File: utils.info,  Node: update,  Prev: texi2ps,  Up: Top

update
******

`update' is a fancy copy-if-needed program.  Basically, it compares the
two files you give it, and if they differ, copies one to the other.
This is useful in makefiles where a file is generated often, but its
contents changes rarely, and other files depend on it.  For example,
`bison' emits a header file each time it parses the grammar.  The
header rarely changes, but the grammar changes often.  So, you use
`update' to copy the header to its real name only when it changes, and
everything else won't need to be recompiled each time.

Usage: `update' NEW_FILE COPIED_TO

Example:

     foo.c foo.h : foo.y
             bison foo.y
             update y_tab.h foo.h
             update y_tab.c foo.c
