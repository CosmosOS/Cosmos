REQUIREMENTS for RHIDE
======================

You need DJGPP version 2.01 (or later) to use RHIDE without any
problems with long command lines. This comes from the fact, that
DJGPP 2.01 uses an other technique to pass long command lines
to spawned programs. That means, if you have installed still
DJGPP 2.0 command lines, which are longer then 126 characters will
be trunced when RHIDE calls any compiler with that line.

RHIDE runs on raw MS-DOS, in a Window 3.1(x) DOS-box, in a 
Windows 95 DOS-box or under Windows NT in a DOS-box. For running
under NT you MUST add the '-M' commandline switch to RHIDE, otherwis
you will get RHIDE crashing already at startup.
This (or any other commandline switch) can be stored also in the
environment variable RHIDEOPT.

This is the binary distribution of RHIDE. Normaly the files should be
installed in the DJGPP root directoy. To install RHIDE, copy the archive
rhide??b.zip (?? stands for the version of RHIDE, e.g. 12 for version 1.2)
to this directory and unpack it with

unzip rhide??b.zip

or when using PKUNZIP

pkunzip -d rhide??b.zip


===========================================================================
WARNING:            Because RHIDE uses the gettext library for
supporting multiple languages and RHIDE can run also under Windows 95
with long filname support you should take of some special things. If
you want to run RHIDE only in one environment (LFN=y or LFN=n) you have to
unzip the archive in that environment whith an unzip program, which handles
correct the filenames. This is needed, because the gettext library searches
the translated texts in a directory called 'LC_MESSAGES' and this will
course problems, if you have created this directory as 'LC_MESSA' and now
want to use RHIDE with LFN=y.
If you want to use RHIDE with and without long filenames, you have to unzip
the archive with long filenames enabled AND the registry of Windows 95
must be modified (if not already done) like stated in the DJGPP FAQ
section 8.2.
===========================================================================


If it was successful, you can now read the documentation for RHIDE in the
format you prefer. In the directory INFO you can find the INFO-file

rhide.info

and in the directory DOC you can find

rhide.html  - the HTML version
rhide.txt   - the ASCII text version

If yout want to get an other format, you need the source archive of RHIDE,
because they are not part of the binary archive. The other possible formats
are:

RHIDE.DVI  - the DVI version produced by TeX
RHIDE.PS   - the postscript version, generated from RHIDE.DVI with dvips


To add the documentation about RHIDE to your main INFO directory
(that's the menu which is shown, when you call info.exe without
any argument), change to the info directory (normaly %DJDIR%/info)
look at the beginning of the file 'rhide.inf' and copy the text
between the two lines
START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
  and
END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY

to the file 'dir.txi'. (common usage is to place such an entry in
alphabetical order) and then run simply

makeinfo dir.txi

Now you can read the RHIDE doc also by running info.exe like

info rhide


Whats new since Version 1.1?
============================

- Many bugs have been fixed. Please consult the 'rhide_ch.log' file
  for more detailed information about the fixed bugs.

- Improved helpsystem.

- Runs now on NT (but only with the '-M' switch)

- Added support for G77

             Have fun with RHIDE
