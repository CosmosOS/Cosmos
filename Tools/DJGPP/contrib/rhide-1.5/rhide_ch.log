..........: I forgot to update this file, so here a summary:
            - Applied editor 0.3.5 => new desktop file format

            - Added disassembler window for debugging on assembler
              level. Not all is working correct but it is a first
              try.

            - Added the processor register to the disassembler window

            - Added ADA support (*.adb *.ads), but dependeny checking
              is not full implemented and also not the error checking

            - Added dual display support on linux, but only available
              when running as root or with setuid root!! (And of course
              only when a secondary monochrome display is available)

            - Enabled the keyboard selection in the help window under
              Linux.

            - Using now for the binaries newer GDB sources with some
              bug-fixes (it allows for instance now to debug programs
              on DJGPP which have mixed SDB and STABS debugging
              information). But RHIDE will still work and compile with
              official GDB 4.16 sources (I hope)

22.08.1997: Released version 1.3b

23.08.1997: For ADA, reading the dependencies now from the .ali files.

            hex(2**63)

27.08.1997: Starting to use RCS for RHIDE itself (with the goal of
            RCS support in RHIDE also)

28.08.1997: Fixed the crash, when using Evaluate/Modify often enough
            (about 15 or 20) without starting a debug session before.
            (witdh and height was not set in gdbinter.c)

02.09.1997: Fixed the bug, that the colors were restored after customizing
            them and then saving the desktop file.

05.09.1997: Added the 'Copy to'/'Paste from' Windows clipboard feature.
